<h1 title="">THE PHANTOM TOWN
<br />MYSTERY</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br />LUCKY LOON</h2>
<p>A whirl of gleaming sand and dust on a
cross desert road in Arizona. The four galloping
objects turned off the road, horses rearing,
riders laughing; the two Eastern girls flushed,
excited; the pale college student exultant; the
cowboy guide enjoying their pleasure. A warm,
sage-scented wind carried the cloud of dust
away from them down into the valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was glorious sport, wasn&rsquo;t it, Mary?&rdquo;
Dora Bellman&rsquo;s olive-tinted face was glowing
joyfully. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t our equestrian teacher
back in Sunnybank Seminary be properly
proud of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lovely Mary Moore, delicately fashioned,
fair as her friend was dark, nodded beamingly,
too out of breath for the moment to speak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>Jerry Newcomb in his picturesque cowboy
garb, blue handkerchief knotted about his neck,
looked admiringly at the smaller girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you two&rsquo;ll want to ride in the
rodeo. I never saw Easterners get saddle-broke
on cow ponies as quick as you have.&rdquo; Then his
gray eyes smiled at the other boy, tall, thin,
pale, who was wiping dust from his shell-rimmed
glasses. &ldquo;Dick Farley, I reckon you&rsquo;ve
ridden before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick flashed a radiant smile which made his
rather plain face momentarily good-looking.
&ldquo;Some,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when I was a kid on Granddad&rsquo;s
farm just out of Boston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry, a little ahead, was leading them slowly
across soft shimmering sand toward a narrow
entrance in cliff-like rocks.</p>
<p>Dora protested, &ldquo;Mary <i>ought</i> to know how to
ride a cow pony since she was born right here
on the desert while I have always lived on the
Hudson River until two weeks ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; Mary retaliated brightly, &ldquo;but,
as you know, I left here when I was eight to go
East to school and since I have <i>never</i> been
back, I haven&rsquo;t much advantage over you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cowboy turned in his saddle and there
was a tender light in his eyes as he looked at
the younger girl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure glad something
fetched you back, Mary, though I&rsquo;m mighty
sorry it was your dad&rsquo;s illness that did it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>Dora, glancing at the pretty face of her best
friend, saw the frank, friendly smile she gave
the cowboy. To herself she thought,&mdash;&ldquo;Jerry
certainly thinks Mary is the sweetest thing he
ever saw, but <i>she</i> only thinks of him as a nice
boy who once, long ago, was her childhood
playmate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had reached the narrow entrance in the
wall of rocks. It was a mysterious looking
spot; a giant gateway leading, the girls knew
not where. On the gleaming sand near the entrance
lay a half-buried skeleton. It looked as
though it might have been that of a man rather
than a beast. The girls exchanged startled
glances, but, as Jerry was riding unconcernedly
through the gateway, they silently followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a dramatic sort of place!&rdquo; Dora exclaimed
in an awed voice as she gazed about
her.</p>
<p>They were on a floor of sand that was circled
about by low mountains, grim, gray, uninviting.
Here and there in crevices a twisted dwarf tree
clung, its roots exposed. There was a death-like
silence in the place. Even the soft rush of
wind over the desert outside could not be heard.</p>
<p>Mary shuddered and rode closer to the cowboy.
&ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;<i>why</i> have you brought
us here? Is there something that you want to
show us?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>The cowboy nodded. &ldquo;You recollect that
Dora was saying how she wished there was a
mystery she could solve&mdash;&rdquo; he began, when he
was interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jerry,&rdquo; Dora&rsquo;s dark eyes glowed with
anticipation, &ldquo;is there <i>really</i> a mystery here&mdash;in
this awfully bleak place? What? Where? I
don&rsquo;t see anything at all but those almost
straight up and down cliffs and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an exultant exclamation from
Dick Farley. Perhaps his strong spectacles
gave him clearer sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a house, honest Injun, I do, or something
that looks powerfully like one.&rdquo; He
turned questioning eyes toward the cowboy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto! You&rsquo;re clever, old man!&rdquo; Jerry
Newcomb told him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell where it is. See
if the girls can find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long silent moment Mary and Dora sat
in their saddles turning their gaze slowly about
the low circling mountains.</p>
<p>Dora&rsquo;s excited cry told the others that she
saw it, and Mary, noting the direction of her
friend&rsquo;s gaze, saw, high on a narrow ledge,
what looked like a wall made of small rocks
with openings that might have been meant for
two windows and a door. The flat roof could
not be seen from the floor of the desert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How perfectly thrilling!&rdquo; Dora cried.
&ldquo;What was it, Jerry, an Indian cliff dwelling?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>The cowboy shook his head. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ride up
closer,&rdquo; he said. He led the way to the very
base of the low mountain. The ledge, which had
one time been the front yard of the house, had
been cracked by the elements and leaned outward,
leaving a crevice of about twenty feet.
There were no steps leading up to the house.
It was, as far as the three Easterners could see,
without a way of approach.</p>
<p>Dick Farley rode about examining the spot
from all angles. &ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;if
it isn&rsquo;t an Indian dwelling, who did live there?
Surely <i>not</i> a white family!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cowboy shook his head. &ldquo;Not a family.
Only a man, Danish, but he was white all right.
Sven Pedersen was his name but everyone
called him &lsquo;Lucky Loon.&rsquo; The name fitted him
on two counts. Lucky because he struck it rich
so often, and he certainly was &lsquo;loony&rsquo; if that
means crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he do?&rdquo; Mary asked, her blue
eyes wide and a little terrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sven Pedersen had a secret&mdash;Dad said&mdash;and
that was why he took to hoarding all the
wealth he got out of his gold and turquoise
mines. My father was a boy then. He says he
hasn&rsquo;t any doubt but that old rock house up
yonder is plastered with gold and turquoise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora asked in amazement, &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t anybody
know? Hasn&rsquo;t anyone <i>ever</i> climbed up there to
see?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No one that I&rsquo;ve heard tell about,&rdquo; Jerry
said. &ldquo;No one cared to risk his life doing it, I
reckon.&rdquo; Then, seeming to feel that he had
sufficiently aroused his listeners&rsquo; curiosity, the
cowboy went on to explain. &ldquo;As Sven Pedersen
grew old, he got queerer and queerer. He took
a notion that he was going to be killed for his
money, so after he&rsquo;d built that rock house, he
shut himself up in it, and if any intruder so
much as rode through that gateway in the
rocks over there, bang would go his gun and
the horse would drop dead. He was sure-shot
all right, Sven Pedersen was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick Farley&rsquo;s large eyes glanced from the
high house out to the gate in the wall of rock.
&ldquo;I bet the rider of the dead horse scuttled
away mighty quick,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon he did,&rdquo; Jerry agreed when Dora
exclaimed in a tone of horror: &ldquo;He must have
shot a man once anyway. Mary and I saw the
half-buried skeleton of one out by the gate. We
were sure we did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; Jerry went on explaining.
&ldquo;You see no one could tell whether the Lucky
Loon was in his house or out of it; no one ever
saw him in the door or on the ledge, but they
found out soon enough when they heard his gun
bang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he get his food and water?&rdquo; Dick
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe there&rsquo;s a spring on the mountain,&rdquo;
Dora suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a spring,&rdquo; the cowboy told them.
&ldquo;These mountains and the desert around here
are bone dry. That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s so many
skeletons of cows hereabout. Some reckoned
that he rode away nights to a town where he
wasn&rsquo;t known. He might have stayed away for
days and got back in the night without anyone
knowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jerry, what happened to him in the
end? Does anybody know? Did he go away?&rdquo;
Dora and Dick were questioning when Mary
cried in sudden alarm, &ldquo;Oh, Jerry, he <i>isn&rsquo;t</i>
here <i>now</i>, is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Dora who replied, &ldquo;Of course not,
Mary. You <i>know</i> Jerry wouldn&rsquo;t bring us in
here if there was any danger of our being
shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon Sven Pedersen&rsquo;s been dead this
long time back,&rdquo; the cowboy told them. &ldquo;Father
was a kid when Lucky Loon was old. Dad says
he and some other kids watched around the
gate rocks, taking turns for almost a week.
They reckoned if the old hermit <i>had</i> gone away,
they&rsquo;d like to climb up there and find the Evil
Eye Turquoise Sven had boasted so much about
before he shut himself up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Did</i> they climb up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What</i> was the eye?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One question at a time, please,&rdquo; Jerry told
the eager girls. &ldquo;No, they didn&rsquo;t go. Dad said
it was his turn to watch one night. There was
a cutting wind and since it was very dark, he
thought he&rsquo;d just slip inside of the rock gate
where the blowing sand wouldn&rsquo;t hit him. Dad
got sort of sleepy, after a time, crouched down
on the sand, when suddenly he heard a gun
bang. He leaped out of the gate, up on his
horse and galloped for home. He laughs when
he tells that story. He reckons now that he&rsquo;d
dreamed the shot since Sven Pedersen never
<i>was</i> seen again and that was thirty years ago.&rdquo;
The cowboy had looked at his watch. &ldquo;Jumping
Steers!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Most milking
time and here I&rsquo;m fifteen miles from the ranch.
Dick, will you ride home with the girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry had whirled his horse&rsquo;s head and had
started for the gateway, the others quickly following.
Dick, at the end, was just passing
through the gate when they distinctly heard the
report of a gun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II
<br />THE GHOST TOWN</h2>
<p>Safely outside of the wall of rocks, the
four young people drew their restless horses to
a standstill. Mary&rsquo;s nettlesome brown pony was
hard to quiet until Jerry reached out a strong
brown hand and patted its head.</p>
<p>Mary lifted startled blue eyes. &ldquo;Jerry, <i>what</i>
do you make of that?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;We <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>
have imagined that gun shot and surely the
horses heard it also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s smile was reassuring. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas the
story that frightened you girls, I reckon,&rdquo; he
said, glancing about and up and down the road
as he spoke. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hunters out after quail or
rabbits, more&rsquo;n like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, seeing that Mary still glanced anxiously
back at the gate in the rock wall, Dick
said sensibly, &ldquo;Of course you girls <i>know</i> that
Sven Pedersen <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> be in that high house.
He <i>must</i> have been dead for years if he was old
when Jerry&rsquo;s father was a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Dora, less inclined to be imaginative,
replied. Then to the cowboy she said
in her practical matter-of-fact way, &ldquo;Hurry
along home to your milking, Jerry, and Dick,
don&rsquo;t you bother to come with us. Now that
you&rsquo;re working on the Newcomb ranch you
ought to be there. It&rsquo;s only a few miles up over
this sunshiny road to Gleeson. We aren&rsquo;t the
least bit afraid to ride home alone, are we?&rdquo;
She smiled at her friend.</p>
<p>Mary, not wishing to appear foolishly timid,
said, in as courageous a voice as she could
muster, &ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;re not afraid. Goodbye,
boys, we&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning the heads of their horses up a gently
ascending mountain road, the girls cantered
away. At a bend, Mary glanced back. The boys
were sitting just where they had left them.
Jerry&rsquo;s sombrero and Dick&rsquo;s cap waved, then,
feeling assured that the girls were all right, the
boys went at a gallop down the road and across
the desert valley to the Newcomb ranch which
nestled at the base of the Chiricahua range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re nice boys, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; Mary said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wished I had a brother and I do
believe Jerry is going to be just like one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aloud Dora replied, &ldquo;I have noticed that
sometimes he calls you &lsquo;Little Sister.&rsquo;&rdquo; To herself
she thought: &ldquo;Oh, Mary, how <i>blind</i> you
are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dreamily the younger girl was saying&mdash;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
because we were playmates when we
were little so very long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my, how ancient we are!&rdquo; Dora said
teasingly. &ldquo;Please remember that you are only
one year younger than I am and I refuse to be
called elderly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary smiled faintly but it was evident that
she was still thinking of the past, when she had
been a little girl with golden curls that hung to
her waist; a wonderfully pretty, wistful little
girl. When she spoke, she said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only
natural that Jerry should call me &lsquo;Little Sister.&rsquo;
Our mothers were like sisters when they were
girl brides. I&rsquo;ve told you how they both came
from the East just as we have. My mother met
Dad in Bisbee where he was a mining engineer,
and Jerry&rsquo;s mother taught a little desert school
over near the Newcomb ranch. She didn&rsquo;t teach
long though, for that very first vacation she
married Jerry&rsquo;s cowboy father. After that
Mother and Mrs. Newcomb were good friends,
naturally, being brides and neighbors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora laughed. &ldquo;Twenty-five miles apart
wouldn&rsquo;t be called <i>close</i> neighbors in Sunnybank-on-the-Hudson
where I come from,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>Mary, not heeding the interruption, kept on.
&ldquo;When Jerry and I were little, we were playmates.
I spent days at the ranch sometimes,&rdquo;
her sweet face was very sad as she ended with,
&ldquo;until Mother died when I was eight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you came East to boarding-school and
became like a sister to me,&rdquo; Dora said tenderly.
&ldquo;Oh, Mary, when you came West to be with
your dear sick dad, I wonder if you know what
it meant to me to be allowed to come with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what it means to <i>me</i> to have you,
Dodo, so I &rsquo;spect it means the same to you,&rdquo;
was the affectionate reply.</p>
<p>For a time the girls cantered along in
thoughtful silence. The rutty road was leading
up toward the tableland on which stood the now
nearly deserted old mining-town of Gleeson.</p>
<p>Far below them the desert valley stretched
many miles southward to the Mexican border.
The girls could see a distant blue haze that was
the smoke from the Douglas copper smelters.</p>
<p>The late afternoon sun lay in floods of silver
light on the sandy road ahead of them. It was
very still. Not a sound was to be heard. Now
and then a rabbit darted past silently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How peaceful this hour is on the desert,&rdquo;
Mary began, glancing at her friend who was
riding so close at her side. Noticing that Dora
was deep in thought, she asked lightly, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
you say it out loud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course. I was just wondering why
Jerry hurried us away so fast from Lucky
Loon&rsquo;s rock house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he had to do the milking,&rdquo; Mary
replied simply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Dora nodded. &ldquo;So he <i>said</i>.&rdquo; Then she hastened
to add, &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m inferring
that Jerry told an untruth, but you know that
some evenings he has stayed with us for supper
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary glanced up startled. &ldquo;Dora Bellman,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;do you think maybe there <i>was</i> someone
up in that rock house watching us all the
time we were there; someone who fired the gun
just as we were leaving to warn us to keep
away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora, seeing her friend&rsquo;s pale face, was sorry
that she had wondered aloud. &ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo;
she said brightly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo; Then
to change the subject, she started another.
&ldquo;Jerry didn&rsquo;t have time to tell us about the
Evil Eye Turquoise, did he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dora, do you know what <i>I</i> think?&rdquo; Mary
exclaimed as one who had made an important
discovery. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he will tell us about
that. I acted so like a scare-cat all the time we
were there, he won&rsquo;t ever take us there again
and he probably won&rsquo;t tell us the story either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll find it out some other way,&rdquo; Dora
declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m crazy about mysteries as you
know, and, if there <i>really is one</i> about that rock
house, I want to try to solve it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>She said no more about it just then, as they
had reached the old ghost town of Gleeson.
They turned up a side street toward mountain
peaks that were about a mile away. On their
right was the corner general store and post
office. A crumbling old adobe building it was,
with a rotting wooden porch, on which stood a
row of armchairs. In the long ago days when
the town had been teeming with life, picturesque
looking miners and ranchers had sat
there tilted back, smoking pipes and swapping
yarns. Today the chairs were empty.</p>
<p>An old man, shriveled, gray-bearded, unkempt,
but with kind gray eyes, deep-sunken
under shaggy brows, stood in the open door. He
smiled out at them in a friendly way, then
beckoned with a bony finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do believe Mr. Harvey has a letter for
us,&rdquo; Dora said.</p>
<p>The old man had shuffled into the dark well
of his store. A moment later he reappeared
with several letters and a newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Dora exclaimed as she rode close to
the porch. &ldquo;Thanks a lot,&rdquo; she called brightly
up to the old man who was handing the packet
down over the sagging wooden rail.</p>
<p>His friendly, toothless smile was directed at
the smaller girl. &ldquo;Heerd tell as how yer pa&rsquo;s
sittin&rsquo; up agin, Miss Mary,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mis&rsquo;
Farley, yer nurse woman, came down ter mail
some letters a spell back.&rdquo; Then, before Mary
could reply, he continued in his shrill, wavering
voice, &ldquo;That thar pale fellar wi&rsquo; specs on is
her son, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Harvey. Dick is Mrs. Farley&rsquo;s
son.&rdquo; Mary took time, in a friendly way, to
satisfy the old man&rsquo;s curiosity. &ldquo;Dick has been
going to the Arizona State University this winter
to be near his mother. She&rsquo;s a widow and
he&rsquo;s her only son. Her husband was a doctor
and they lived back in Boston before he died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dew tell!&rdquo; the old man wagged his head
sympathetically. &ldquo;I seen the young fellar
ridin&rsquo; around wi&rsquo; Jerry Newcomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick&rsquo;s working on the Newcomb ranch this
summer,&rdquo; Mary said, as she started to ride on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! Ho!&rdquo; the old man cackled. &ldquo;Tenderfoot
if ever thar was un. What&rsquo;s Jerry reckonin&rsquo;
that young fellar kin do? Bustin&rsquo; broncs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary smiled in appreciation of the old man&rsquo;s
joke. &ldquo;No, Jerry won&rsquo;t expect Dick to do <i>that</i>
right at first. He&rsquo;s official fence-mender just at
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora defended the absent boy. &ldquo;Mr. Harvey,
you wait until Dick has been on the desert long
enough to get a coat of tan; he <i>may</i> surprise
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, mabbe! mabbe!&rdquo; the old storekeeper
chuckled to himself as the girls, waving back at
him, galloped away up the road in the little
dead town.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p><a href="#front" id="rfront">On either side there were deserted adobe houses</a>
in varying degrees of ruin, some with
broken windows and doors, others with sagging
roofs and crumbling walls.</p>
<p>The only sign of life was in three small
adobes where poor Mexican families lived.
Broken windows in two of the houses were
stuffed with rags; the door yards were littered
with rubbish. Unkempt children played in front
of the middle house. The third adobe was neat
and well kept. In it lived the Lopez family.
Carmelita, the wife and mother, had long been
cook for Mary Moore&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>A bright, black-eyed Mexican boy of about
ten ran out to the road as the girls approached.
&ldquo;Come on, Emanuel,&rdquo; Mary sang down to him.
&ldquo;You may put up our horses and earn a dime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The small boy&rsquo;s white teeth flashed in a delighted
grin. His brown feet raced so fast, that,
by the time the girls were dismounting before
the big square two-storied adobe near the mountains,
Emanuel was there to lead their horses
around back.</p>
<p>Mary glanced affectionately at the old place
with its flower-edged walk, its broad porch and
adobe pillars. Here her mother had come as a
bride; here Mary had been born. Eight happy
years they had spent together before her
mother died. After Mary had been taken East
to school, her father had returned, and here he
had spent the winters, going back to Sunnybank
each summer to be with his little girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>Hurrying up the steps, Mary skipped into a
pleasant living-room, where, near a wide window
that was letting in a flood of light from the
setting sun, sat her fine-looking father, pale
after his long illness, but growing stronger
every day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Daddy dear!&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s voice was vibrant
with love. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve waited up for me, haven&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; She dropped to her knees beside the invalid
chair and pressed her flushed face to his
gray, drawn cheek.</p>
<p>Then, glancing up at the nurse who had appeared
from her father&rsquo;s bedroom, she asked
eagerly, &ldquo;May I tell Dad an adventure we&rsquo;ve
had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Farley, middle-aged, kind-faced, shook
her head, smiling down at the girl. &ldquo;Not tonight,
please. Won&rsquo;t tomorrow do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary sprang up, saying brightly, &ldquo;I reckon
it will have to.&rdquo; Then, stooping, she kissed her
father as she whispered tenderly, &ldquo;Rest well,
darling. We&rsquo;re hoping you know all about&mdash;&rdquo;
then, little girl fashion, she clapped her hand
on her mouth, mumbling, &ldquo;Oh, I most disobeyed
and <i>told</i> our adventure. See you tomorrow,
Daddy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br />THE MISSING FRIENDS</h2>
<p>Upstairs, in Mary&rsquo;s room which was furnished
as it had been when she had been there
as a child, curly maple set with blue hangings,
the two girls changed from riding habits to
house dresses. Mary wore a softly clinging blue
while Dora donned her favorite and most becoming
cherry color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One might think that we are expecting company
tonight.&rdquo; Mary was peering into the oval
glass as she spoke, arranging her fascinating
golden curls above small shell-like ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which, of course, we are <i>not</i>.&rdquo; Dora had
brushed her black bob, boy-fashion, slick to her
head. &ldquo;There being no near neighbors to drop
in.&rdquo; Then suddenly she exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, for
goodness sakes alive, I completely forgot that
letter. It&rsquo;s for both of us from Polly and Patsy.
I&rsquo;ve been wondering why they didn&rsquo;t write and
tell us where they had decided to spend their
summer vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Dora sprang up to search for the letter in a
pocket of her riding habit. Mary sat near a
window in a curly maple rocker as she said
dreamily: &ldquo;If we hadn&rsquo;t come West, we would
have been with them&mdash;that is, if they went to
Camp Winnichook up in the Adirondacks the
way we had planned all winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora, holding the letter unopened, sat near
her friend and smiled at her reminiscently as
she said, &ldquo;We plan and plan and plan for the
future, don&rsquo;t we, and then we do something
exactly different, and <i>most</i> unexpected, but <i>I</i>
wouldn&rsquo;t give up being out here on the desert
and living in a ghost town for all the fun Patsy
and Polly may be having&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary laughingly interrupted. &ldquo;Do read the
letter and let&rsquo;s see if they really <i>did</i> go there.
Perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they did.&rdquo; Dora had unfolded a large,
boyish-looking sheet of paper. &ldquo;Camp Winnichook,&rdquo;
she announced, then she read the
rather indolent scrawl. &ldquo;Dear Cowgirls,&rdquo;&mdash;it
began&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patsy has just come in from a swim. She&rsquo;s
drying her bathing suit by lying on the sand in
front of the cabin in the sun. Her red hair,
which <i>she</i> calls &lsquo;a wind blown mop,&rsquo; looks, at
present, like a mop that has just finished doing
the kitchen floor. Last winter, you recall, she
had a <i>few</i> red freckles on her saucy pug nose,
but now she wears them all over her face and
arms and even on her back. She&rsquo;s a sight to
behold!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>There were spatters on the paper that might
have been water. The type of penmanship
changed. A jerky, uneven handwriting seemed
to ejaculate indignantly, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you kids believe
a word of it. I&rsquo;m a dazzling beauty&mdash;as
ever! It&rsquo;s Polly whose looks are ruined&mdash;if she
ever had any. She won&rsquo;t play tennis and she
<i>won&rsquo;t</i> swim and she <i>will</i> eat chocolate drops&mdash;you
know the finish, and she wasn&rsquo;t any too
slim last year when she <i>had</i> to do gym.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first penmanship took up the tale. &ldquo;I
had to forcibly push Patsy away. She&rsquo;s gone
in to dress now, so I&rsquo;ll hurry and get this letter
into an envelope and sealed before she gets
back because I want to tell on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know Pat has always said she was a
boy hater, and the more the boys from Wales
Military Academy rushed her, the more she
would shrug her shoulders and &lsquo;pouff!&rsquo; about
them, but she&rsquo;s met her Waterloo. There&rsquo;s a
flying field near our camp and a boy named
Harry Hulbert is there studying to be a pilot.
Pat and I strolled over to the field one day and
ever since she caught sight of that tall, slim
chap all done up in his flying togs, she&rsquo;s been
wild to meet him. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if
she&rsquo;s even hoping that his machine will crash
some day right in front of our cabin so that she
can bind up his wounds and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>Once again the jerky, uneven writing seemed
to exclaim, &ldquo;Silly gilly! <i>That&rsquo;s what</i> Polly is!
It isn&rsquo;t the flier, it&rsquo;s the flying that <i>I&rsquo;m</i> crazy
about. I <i>do</i> wish I knew that Harry Hulbert,
but not for any sentimental reasons, believe
me. Pouff&mdash;for all of &rsquo;em! But fly I&rsquo;m going
to!! In truth, if you girls stay West until the
end of vacation, you <i>may</i> see an airplane landing
in your ghost town&mdash;me piloting!!!???&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came a wide space and when the writing
began again, it was dated three days later
and was Polly&rsquo;s lazy scrawl. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to laugh!&rdquo;
she began. &ldquo;But, to explain. If you wish hard
enough for anything, it&rsquo;s <i>bound</i> to happen. Not
that Harry Hulbert&rsquo;s plane crashed in front of
our cabin but it was forced down when Patsy
and I were out in her little green car far from
human habitation. Of course we hadn&rsquo;t gone
riding <i>just</i> because we <i>saw</i> that particular little
silver plane practicing up in the air&mdash;oh, no&mdash;not
at all!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Patsy&rsquo;s jerky scribble interrupted. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a
mean, horrid, misrepresenting person, Polly
Perkins is! She knows perfectly well we <i>had</i> to
go to the village to get a pound of butter for
our camp mother, and wasn&rsquo;t it only <i>polite</i> for
us to give that poor stranded boy a lift? He <i>is</i>
a real decent sort, even though the only thing
<i>he&rsquo;s</i> crazy about is flying, but we <i>did</i> learn
something about him. His father has some sort
of a government position in Arizona, where <i>you</i>
are, no less. I mean, in the same state, and
when Harry gets his pilot&rsquo;s license, he is to be
a flying scout, he told us. He said it will be an
awfully exciting life. When there has been a
holdup out there on a stage or a train and the
bandits leap on to their horses and flee across
the border, Harry is to pursue them in his little
silver plane and see where they go. Then he&rsquo;ll
circle back to where a posse is waiting, notify
them, and so the bandits will be captured.
Won&rsquo;t that be simply too thrilling for words?
Oh, <i>why</i> wasn&rsquo;t I born a boy? I could have been
Patrick, then, instead of Patsy. Believe me,
when Harry Hulbert gets his license, and it
won&rsquo;t be long now&mdash;he&rsquo;s <i>that</i> good&mdash;don&rsquo;t I
wish I could be a stowaway in his plane! We&rsquo;d
have to leave Polly here though. She&rsquo;s so
heavy, the plane wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get off of
the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lazy scrawl concluded the epistle. &ldquo;If
Patsy goes West, so do I, but I&rsquo;ll go by train.
I have no romantic urge to take to the air with
slim, goggle-eyed young men with a purpose in
life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our camp mother (nice Mrs. Higgins, Jane&rsquo;s
aunt, came with us this year) is calling us to
lunch, and right after that Pat and I are going
to town to mail this. Pat wants me to say that
when <i>her</i> friend Mister Harry Hulbert <i>does</i> fly
West, she&rsquo;ll give him a letter of introduction
to you two and I calls that right generous of
her considering&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pouff!&rdquo; came a brief interruption. Then
&ldquo;Goodbye. We&rsquo;re signing off. Patsy Ordelle
and Polly Perkins of the famous Sunnybank
Seminary Quadralettes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a jolly letter!&rdquo; Mary said.
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fun if the missing members of
our little clan could be here with us. Patsy is
as wild about mystery stories as you are and
this ghost town just teems with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rich, musical voice drifted up from the
back porch, &ldquo;Se&ntilde;oritas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good! There&rsquo;s Carmelita calling us to
supper, and <i>am I hungry</i>?&rdquo; Dora tossed the
letter on the dresser and slipping an arm about
her friend, she gave her a little impulsive hug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t envy Pat and Poll, not the least little
mite,&rdquo; she said as they went down the broad
front stairway together. &ldquo;It <i>is</i> lovely at Camp
Winnichook as we well know, since we&rsquo;ve been
there with them the past three summers, but
the desert has a lure for me that the little blue
lake in the mountains never did have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Mary agreed. &ldquo;Those mountains
are more like pretty hills. There&rsquo;s nothing
grim or grand about them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>They entered a large, pleasant kitchen, in one
corner of which, between two windows, was a
table spread with a red cloth. A good-looking
middle-aged Mexican woman, dressed in bright
colors, stood at the stove preparing to dish up
their meal. &ldquo;<i>Buenos dias, ni&ntilde;as</i>,&rdquo; she said in
her deep, musical voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Carmelita,&rdquo; the girls replied,
and then, when they had been served
generous portions of the Americanized Mexican
dish which the girls called &ldquo;tamale pie,&rdquo;
Dora flashed at the smiling cook a pleased
glance as she said, &ldquo;<i>Muchas gracias, Se&ntilde;ora</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then to Mary, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t take long to use
up all the Spanish <i>I</i> know. Let&rsquo;s take a vow
that when we go back to Sunnybank Seminary
next fall we will add Spanish to&mdash;&rdquo; A wistful
expression in her friend&rsquo;s face caused Dora to
pause and exclaim in real alarm, &ldquo;Mary Moore,
do you think, because of your dad, that you
<i>won&rsquo;t</i> be able to go back East to school? You
have only one year more before you graduate.
You know how we four of &lsquo;The Quadralettes&rsquo;
have counted on graduating together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary smiled brightly. &ldquo;Of course, I expect
to go and take Dad with me.&rdquo; Her momentary
wistful doubting had passed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>They had finished their supper and were
rising when Carmelita, who had been out on
the back porch, hurried in and began a rapid
chattering in her own language. The mystified
girls could not understand one word. But, as
the Mexican woman kept pointing out toward
the road, they felt sure that someone was
coming toward the house, nor were they wrong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br />&ldquo;DESPERATE DICK&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Skipping to the vine-covered back porch,
the two girls peered through the deepening
dusk at the approaching car. In it were two
boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of them resembles Jerry,&rdquo; Mary said,
&ldquo;but the other one is also a cowboy, so it can&rsquo;t
be Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Dick!&rdquo; Dora exclaimed gleefully.
&ldquo;Jerry must have loaned him some cowboy
togs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Happy Days!&rdquo; Mary exulted. &ldquo;Now
we can ask Jerry about that Evil Eye Turquoise
and all the rest of the story about poor
Mr. Lucky Loon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there is any rest to it,&rdquo; Dora remarked.
&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she interrupted herself to point
laughingly at the little car that was rattling
toward them. &ldquo;Dick is waving his sombrero.
He wants us to be sure and take notice of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he proud though?&rdquo; Mary chuckled.
&ldquo;His face fairly shines.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>Then, as the small car drew up near the
porch, the girls clapped their hands gaily, and
yet quietly, remembering that Mary&rsquo;s invalid
father might be asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dick,&rdquo; Dora exclaimed, not trying to
hide her admiration, &ldquo;your mother must see
her to-be-physician son. You make a regular
screen-star cowboy, doesn&rsquo;t he, Mary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the other girl could reply, Dick, who
had leaped to the ground, struck a ridiculous
pose as he said in a deep, dramatic voice,
&ldquo;Dick, the Desperate Range Rider.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora&rsquo;s infectious laugh rang out. &ldquo;Your
big, dark eyes look so solemn through those
shell-rimmed glasses, Mr. Desperate Dick, that
somehow you fail to strike terror into our
hearts,&rdquo; she bantered.</p>
<p>Then Mary smiled up at Jerry, who was
standing near her. Half teasingly she asked,
&ldquo;To what do we owe the honor of this visit?
When we parted this afternoon, you called
&lsquo;we&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry glanced at the other boy, mischievous
twinkles in his gray eyes. &ldquo;You might as well
&rsquo;fess up, old man. Truth is, Dick couldn&rsquo;t wait
until tomorrow to let you girls admire him in
his cowboy togs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Villain!&rdquo; Dick tried to glower at his betraying
friend, but ended by beaming upon
him with a most friendly grin. &ldquo;I suppose I
<i>had</i> to <i>rope</i> you and drag you over here quite
against your will.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s smile at the curly-headed little girl
at his side revealed, more than words, the real
reason of his coming. What he said was, &ldquo;Mom
had a letter she wanted mailed and&mdash;er&mdash;as
long as Dick wanted to show off, I reckoned&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jerry,&rdquo; Mary caught his arm, &ldquo;it
really doesn&rsquo;t matter in the least <i>why</i> you
came. I was wild to see you&mdash;&rdquo; then, when the
tall cowboy began to glow with pride, Mary
quite spoiled her compliment by hurrying to
add, &ldquo;Oh, it wasn&rsquo;t <i>you</i> that I wanted to see.&rdquo;
Jerry pretended to be greatly crestfallen, so
she laughingly added, &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m <i>always</i>
glad to see you, Big Brother, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; Dora rushed to her friend&rsquo;s
rescue. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting all tangled up.&rdquo; Then
to Jerry, &ldquo;Mary and I are wild to know more
about that awfully desolate stone house you
showed us this afternoon and about the Evil
Eye Turquoise&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and about poor Mr. Lucky Loon&mdash;&rdquo;
Mary put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather a contradictory description, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; Dick asked. &ldquo;How can a man be poor and
lucky all in one sentence?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what.&rdquo; Jerry had a plan to
suggest. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down to the store and get
old Silas Harvey to tell us all that he knows
about Lucky Loon. I reckon he&rsquo;d loosen up for
you girls, but he never would for me. He knows
more than any other living person about that
rock house and the mystery of Sven Pedersen&rsquo;s
life&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good!&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s animated face was
lovely to look upon in the starlight. Jerry&rsquo;s
eyes would have told her so, had she read them
aright, but her thoughts were not of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk down,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
such a lovely night.&rdquo; Then she added, &ldquo;Wait
here while Dora and I go up to our room and
put on our sweater coats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need them!&rdquo; Dick commented.
&ldquo;Even in June these desert nights are nippy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls, hand in hand, fairly danced
through the wide lower hall, but so softly that
no sound could penetrate the closed door beyond
which Mary&rsquo;s father slept.</p>
<p>They did not need to light the kerosene lamp.
The two long door-like windows in Mary&rsquo;s
room were letting in a flood of soft, silvery
starlight. Dora found her flash and her jaunty
green sweater coat. &ldquo;It looks better with this
cherry-colored dress than my pink one,&rdquo; she
chattered, &ldquo;and your yellow coat looks too
sweet for anything with that blue dress. Happy
Days, but doesn&rsquo;t Jerry think you&rsquo;re too pretty
to be real? His eyes almost eat you up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Silly!&rdquo; Mary retorted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s utterly impossible
for Jerry and me to fall in love with
each other. Goodness, didn&rsquo;t we play together
when we were babies?&rdquo; Her tone seemed to
imply that no more could possibly be said upon
the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one is so blind as he who will not see,&rdquo;
Dora sing-songed her trite quotation, then,
fearing that Mary would not like so much
teasing, she slipped a loving arm about her
and gave her a little contrite hug. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise
to join the blind hereafter, if you think I&rsquo;m
seeing too much, Mary dear,&rdquo; she promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re <i>imagining</i> too much,&rdquo; was
the laughing rejoinder. &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s tiptoe
downstairs, and oh, I must tap at the sitting-room
door and tell nice Mrs. Farley where we
are going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just before Mary tapped, however, the door
opened softly and Dick appeared, his mother
closely following, her rather tired brown eyes
adoring him. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I the nicest cowboy
son?&rdquo; she asked the girls, glancing from one to
the other impartially.</p>
<p>It was Dora who replied, &ldquo;We think so, Mrs.
Farley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; the mother leaned forward to
kiss the boy&rsquo;s pale cheek, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not be entirely
satisfied until you&rsquo;re as brown as Jerry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Dick told you that we girls are
going?&mdash;&rdquo; Mary began.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>Mrs. Farley nodded pleasantly. &ldquo;Down to
the post office? Yes, I hope you&rsquo;ll find that
ancient storekeeper in a garrulous mood. Good
night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry was seated on the top step of the back
porch waiting for them. They caught a dreamy
far-away expression in his gray eyes. He was
looking across the shimmering distance to the
Chiricahua Mountains, and thinking of the time
when he would build, on his own five hundred
acres, a home for someone. He glanced up
almost guiltily when Mary&rsquo;s finger tips gave
him a light caress on his sun-tanned cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Jerry,&rdquo; she teased, &ldquo;are you star-dreaming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang to his feet. &ldquo;I reckon I <i>was</i>
dreaming, sure enough, Little Sister,&rdquo; he
confessed.</p>
<p>Mary slipped her slim, white hand under his
khaki-covered arm, and, smiling up at him with
frank friendship, she said, &ldquo;The road down
the hill is so rough and hobbly, I&rsquo;m going to
hang on to you, may I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora did not hear the cowboy&rsquo;s low spoken
reply, for Dick was speaking to her, but to herself
she thought, &ldquo;Some day a miracle will be
performed and she who is now blind will see,
and great will be the revelation.&rdquo; Then, self-rebuking
and aloud, &ldquo;Oh, Dick, forgive me,
what were you saying? I reckon, as Jerry says,
that I was thinking of something else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not very complimentary to your present
companion.&rdquo; Dick pretended to be quite downcast
about it. &ldquo;I merely asked if I might aid
you over the ruts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora laughed gleefully. &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; she said in
a low voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell you what I was
thinking. I was wondering why Mary doesn&rsquo;t
notice that Jerry likes her extra-special.&rdquo;
Dick&rsquo;s eyes were wide in the starlight. &ldquo;Does
he? I hadn&rsquo;t noticed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora laughed and changed the subject. &ldquo;Oh,
Dick, isn&rsquo;t this the shudderin&rsquo;est, spookiest
place there ever was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had passed the three small adobe huts
that were occupied by Mexican families and
were among the old crumbling houses, which,
in the dim light, looked more haunted than they
had in the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that each one holds memories of
sudden riches won, and many of them have
secrets of tragedies,&mdash;<i>murders</i> even, maybe.&rdquo;
Dora shuddered and drew closer to Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i> imaginative tonight,&rdquo; he said,
smiling at her startled, olive-tinted face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
quite a leap, though, from romance to gunfights
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>Mary turned to call back to them, &ldquo;Jerry
and I have it all planned, just what we are to
do. I&rsquo;m to ask some innocent question and,
Dora, you&rsquo;re to help me out, but we mustn&rsquo;t appear
<i>too</i> interested or too prying, Jerry says,
or for some reason, quite unknown, old Mr.
Harvey will put on the clam act. Shh! Here
we are! Good, there&rsquo;s a light. Now Jerry is
to speak his piece first and I am to chime in.
Then, Dora, you take your cue from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick whispered close to his companion&rsquo;s ear,
&ldquo;I evidently haven&rsquo;t a speaking part in the
tragedy or comedy about to be enacted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora giggled. &ldquo;You can be scenery,&rdquo; she
teased, recalling to Dick the forgotten fact that
he was wearing a cowboy outfit for the first
time and feeling rather awkward in it.</p>
<p>Jerry opened the door, a jangling bell rang;
then he stepped aside and let Mary enter first.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br />POOR LITTLE BODIL</h2>
<p>Old Mr. Harvey was dozing in a tilted armchair
close to his stove. He sat up with a start
when his discordant-toned bell rang, and
blinked into the half-darkness near the door.
The smoked chimney on his hanging kerosene
lamp in the middle of the room and near the
ceiling did little to illumine the place. When he
saw who his visitors were, he gave his queer
cackling laugh, &ldquo;Wall, I&rsquo;ll be dinged ef I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
a dreamin&rsquo; I was back in holdup days and that
some of them thar bandits was bustin&rsquo; in to
clean out my stock.&rdquo; Then, as he rose, almost
creakingly, he said, disparagingly, as he
glanced about at the dust and cobweb-covered
shelves, &ldquo;Not as how they&rsquo;d find onythin&rsquo; <i>now</i>
worth the totin&rsquo; away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having, by that time, gone around back of
his long counter, he peered through misty
spectacles at Mary. &ldquo;Is thar suthin&rsquo; I could be
gettin&rsquo; fer yo&rsquo;, Little Miss?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Jerry stepped forward and placed a half
dollar on the counter. &ldquo;Stamps, please, Mr.
Harvey,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I reckon that&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;re
wanting tonight, thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cowboy put the stamps in his pocket,
dropped his mother&rsquo;s letter in a slot, and
turned, as though he were about to leave, but
Mary detained him with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jerry, you don&rsquo;t have to hurry away,
do you? I thought,&rdquo; her sweet appealing smile
turned toward the old man, &ldquo;that perhaps Mr.
Harvey might be willing to tell us a story if we
stayed awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho&rsquo; as shootin&rsquo;!&rdquo; the unkempt old man
seemed pleased indeed to walk into Mary&rsquo;s
trap. &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; set here, Little Miss.&rdquo; It was his
own chair by the stove he was offering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; Mary protested. &ldquo;That one
just fits you. Jerry and Dick are bringing some
in from the porch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys sat on the counter. The girls, trying
to hide triumphant smiles, drew their chairs
close to the stove. Old Mr. Harvey put in another
stick. Then, chewing on an end of gray
whisker, he peered over his glasses at Mary a
moment, before asking, &ldquo;Was thar anythin&rsquo;
special yo&rsquo; wanted to hear tell about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary leaned forward, her pretty face animated:
&ldquo;Oh, yes, Mr. Harvey. This afternoon
Dora and I saw that small stone house that&rsquo;s
built so it&rsquo;s almost hidden on a cliff of the
mountains. Can you tell us anything about the
man who built it; <i>why</i> he did it and what became
of him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s shaggy brows drew together
thoughtfully. He seemed to hesitate. Mary
glanced at Dora, who said with eager interest,
&ldquo;Oh, <i>that would</i> be a thrilling story, I&rsquo;m sure.
I&rsquo;d just love to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wisely the boys, who were not in the line of
the old man&rsquo;s vision, said nothing. In fact, he
seemed to have forgotten their presence.</p>
<p>The storekeeper was silent for so long, staring
straight ahead of him at the stove, that
the girls thought they, also, had been forgotten.
Then suddenly he looked up and smiled
toothlessly at Mary, nodding his grizzly head
many times before he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall,&rdquo; he said at last, almost as though he
were speaking to an unseen presence, &ldquo;I reckon
Sven Pedersen wouldn&rsquo;t want to hold me to
secrecy no longer&mdash;thirty year back &rsquo;tis, sence
he&mdash;&rdquo; suddenly he paused and held up a bony,
shaky hand. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hear no gun shot,
did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls had heard nothing. They glanced
almost fearfully up at the boys. Jerry shook
his head and put a finger to his lips.</p>
<p>The girls understood that he thought it wise
that the old man continue to forget their
presence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, I reckon the wind&rsquo;s risin&rsquo; an&rsquo; suthin&rsquo;
loose banged. Thar&rsquo;s plenty loose, that&rsquo;s sartin.&rdquo;
Then, turning rather blankly toward
Mary, he asked in a child-like manner, &ldquo;What
was we talkin&rsquo; about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary drew her chair closer and smiled confidingly
at him. &ldquo;You were going to tell us,
Mr. Harvey, <i>why</i> Mr. Pedersen built that rock
house and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho&rsquo;! Sho&rsquo;! So I was. It was forty year
last Christmas he come to Gleeson. A tall,
skinny fellar he was, not so very old nor so
young neither. It was an awful blizzardy night
an&rsquo; thar wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t nobody at all out in the streets.
I was jest reckonin&rsquo; as how I&rsquo;d turn in, when
the door bust open an&rsquo; the wind tore things
offen the shelves. I had to help get it shet.
Then I looked at what had blown in. He looked
like a fellar that was most starved an&rsquo; more&rsquo;n
half crazy. His palish blue eyes was wild. I
sot him down in this here chair by the fire an&rsquo;
staked him to some hot grub. I&rsquo;d seen half-starved
critters eat. He snapped at the grub
jest that-a-way. When he&rsquo;d et till I reckoned
as how he&rsquo;d bust, he sank down in that chair
an&rsquo; dod blast it, ef he didn&rsquo;t start snorin&rsquo;, an&rsquo;
he hadn&rsquo;t sed nothin&rsquo;, nohow. Wall, I seen as
how he wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to wake, so I lay down on
my bunk wi&rsquo; my clothes on, sort o&rsquo; sleepin&rsquo; wi&rsquo;
one eye open, not knowin&rsquo; what sort of a loon
I was givin&rsquo; shelter to.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The blizzard kep&rsquo; on all the next day an&rsquo;
the next. Not a gol-darned soul come to the
store, so me&rsquo;n&rsquo; and him had plenty o&rsquo; time to
get to knowin&rsquo; each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arter he&rsquo;d drunk some hot coffee, he unloosed
his tongue, though what he sed was so
half-forrin, I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t quick to cotch onto his
meanin&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The heft o&rsquo; his yarn was like this. He an&rsquo;
his little sister, Bodil, he named her, had come
from Denmark to New York. Thar he&rsquo;d picked
up some o&rsquo; Ameriky&rsquo;s way o&rsquo; talking, an&rsquo; enuf
money to git West. Some Danish fellar had tol&rsquo;
him about these here rich-quick mines, so he&rsquo;d
took a stage an&rsquo; fetched Bodil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man paused, and Mary, leaning
forward, put her hand on his arm. &ldquo;Oh, Mr.
Harvey, tell us about that little girl. How old
was she and what happened to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s head shook sadly. &ldquo;Bad enuf
things happened to her, I reckon. She must o&rsquo;
been a purty little critter. Chiny blue eyes,
Sven Pedersen sed she had, an&rsquo; hair like yellar
cornsilk when it fust comes out. She was the
apple o&rsquo; his eye. The only livin&rsquo; thing he keered
for. I sho&rsquo; was plumb sorry fer him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>do</i> tell us what happened to her?&rdquo;
Mary urged, fearing that the old man&rsquo;s thought
was wandering.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, &rsquo;pears like the stage was held up on
a mount&rsquo;in road nigh here; the wust road in the
country hereabouts. Thar wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no passengers
but Sven Pedersen an&rsquo; Little Bodil; the
long journey bein&rsquo; about to an end. That thar
blizzard was a threatenin&rsquo; an&rsquo; the stage driver
was hurryin&rsquo; his hosses, hopin&rsquo; to get over the
mountain afore it struck, when up rode three
men. One of &rsquo;em shot the driver, another of
&rsquo;em dragged out a bag of gold ore; then they
fired over the hosses&rsquo; heads. Skeered and
rarin&rsquo;, them hosses plunged over the cliff, an&rsquo;
down that stage crashed into the wust gulch
thar is in these here parts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sven saw his little sister throwed out into
the road. Then, as the stage keeled over, he
jumped an&rsquo; cotched onto some scrub tree
growin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; the cliff. It tuk him a long spell
to climb back to the road. He was loony wild wi&rsquo;
worryin&rsquo; about Little Bodil. He ran to whar
he&rsquo;d seen her throwed out. <i>She wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t thar.</i> He
hunted an&rsquo; called, but thar wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no answer.
Then he reckoned as how that thar third bandit
had whirled back an&rsquo; carried her off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Harvey, how terrible!&rdquo; There
were tears in Mary&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t she <i>ever</i>
found?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>The old man shook his head sadly. &ldquo;Sven
Pedersen follered them bandits afoot all night
an&rsquo; nex&rsquo; day but they was a horseback an&rsquo; he
couldn&rsquo;t even get sight o&rsquo; them. Then the blizzard
struck an&rsquo; he staggered in here, bein&rsquo; as
he saw my light. Arter that he went prospectin&rsquo;
all around these here mount&rsquo;ins an&rsquo; he
struck it rich. That cliff, whar he built him a
rock house, was one of his claims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he never stopped hunting for
poor Little Bodil.&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s voice was tender
with sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; reckon right, little gal. Whenever Sven
Pedersen heerd tell of a holdup anywhar in the
state, he&rsquo;d join the posse that was huntin&rsquo; &rsquo;em
but it warn&rsquo;t no use, nohow. Bodil was plumb
gone. Sven Pedersen never made no friend but
me. His palish blue eyes allays kept that wild
look, an&rsquo;, as time went on an&rsquo; he piled up gold
an&rsquo; turquoise, he got to be dubbed &lsquo;Lucky
Loon.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man paused and started to nod his
shaggy gray head so many times that Dora,
fearing he would nod himself to sleep, asked,
&ldquo;Mr. Harvey, <i>what</i> was his Evil Eye Turquoise?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; The old man glanced up suspiciously.
&ldquo;So yo&rsquo;d heerd tell about <i>that</i>.&rdquo; Then he
cackled his queer, cracked laugh. &ldquo;I heerd
about it, but I&rsquo;d allays reckoned thar wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no
sech thing. I cal&rsquo;lated Sven Pedersen made up
that thar yarn to keep folks from climbin&rsquo; up
ter his rock house an&rsquo; stealin&rsquo; his gold an&rsquo; turquoise,
if be that&rsquo;s whar he kept it. I reckon
as how that&rsquo;s the heft o&rsquo; <i>that</i> yarn an&rsquo; yet, I
dunno, I dunno. Mabbe thar was suthin&rsquo; to it.
Mabbe thar was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Harvey, we&rsquo;d like awfully well to
hear the story whether it&rsquo;s true or not, unless,&rdquo;
Mary said solicitously, &ldquo;unless you&rsquo;re too
sleepy to tell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man sat up and opened his eyes wide.
&ldquo;Sleepy, <i>me</i> sleepy? Never was waked up
more! Wall, this here is the heft of that tale.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br />THE EVIL-EYE TURQUOISE</h2>
<p>The old man continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sven Pedersen hisself never tol&rsquo; me nothin&rsquo;
about that Evil Eye Turquoise o&rsquo; his&rsquo;n. <i>That&rsquo;s</i>
why I cal&rsquo;late it was a yarn he used to skeer
off onweloome visitors to his rock house, bein&rsquo;
as thar was spells when he was away fer days,
huntin&rsquo; fer Bodil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heerd it was a big eye-shaped rock with
a round center that was more green than it
was blue. Hangers-on in the store here used to
spec&rsquo;late &rsquo;bout it. Some reckoned, ef &rsquo;twas true
that Sven <i>had</i> found a green-blue turquoise
big as a coffee cup, it&rsquo;d be wurth a lot o&rsquo; money,
but I dunno, I dunno!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora recalled Mr. Harvey&rsquo;s wandering
thoughts by asking, &ldquo;It must have been very
beautiful, but <i>why</i> was it called &lsquo;Evil Eye?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man shook his head. &ldquo;Thar was
folks who&rsquo;d believe onythin&rsquo; in them days,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I reckon thar still is. Superstitious,
yo&rsquo;d call it, so, when Sven Pedersen tol&rsquo; yarns
&rsquo;bout that green-blue eye o&rsquo; his&rsquo;n, thar <i>was</i>
them as swallowed &rsquo;em whule.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us one of the yarns,&rdquo; Mary urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, Lucky Loon tol&rsquo; &rsquo;round at the camps,
as how he&rsquo;d put that thar turquoise eye into
the inside wall o&rsquo; his house jest whar it could
keep watchin&rsquo; the door, an&rsquo; ef onyone tried to
climb in, that thar eye&rsquo;d <i>see</i> &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what if it did,&rdquo; Dora laughed. &ldquo;Was
there ever anyone superstitious enough to believe
that the eye could <i>hurt</i> them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man nodded, looking at her solemnly.
&ldquo;Sven Pedersen tol&rsquo; &rsquo;round that &rsquo;twas a
demon eye, an&rsquo; that whatever it looked at,
&rsquo;ceptin&rsquo; hisself, &rsquo;d keel over paralyzed. Wall,
mabbe it&rsquo;s hard to believe, but them miners,
bad as some of &rsquo;em was, warn&rsquo;t takin&rsquo; no
chances till &rsquo;long come a tenderfoot fellar from
the East. He heern the yarn, an&rsquo; he laffed at
the whule outfit of &rsquo;em. He opined as how he&rsquo;d
come West to get rich quick, an&rsquo; he reckoned
cleanin&rsquo; out that rock house o&rsquo; its gold an&rsquo; turquoise&rsquo;d
be a sight easier than gettin&rsquo; it out
o&rsquo; the earth wi&rsquo; pick an&rsquo; shovel. Yessir, that
fellar did a power o&rsquo; a lot o&rsquo; boastin&rsquo;, but yo&rsquo;
kin better believe, &rsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t when Lucky Loon
was in hearin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora glanced up at the two boys sitting so
silently on the counter back of the old man. She
saw that they were both listening with interest.
The story was evidently as new to Jerry as to
the others. Dick motioned to Dora to ask another
question as the old man had paused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Harvey,&rdquo; she leaned forward to
ask, &ldquo;did that bragging boy actually try to rob
Mr. Pedersen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sure sartin did,&rdquo; the storekeeper replied.
&ldquo;He watched over the rocks o&rsquo; nights
till he&rsquo;d seen Lucky Loon ridin&rsquo; off, and, jedging
by the pack he was totin&rsquo;, that fellar cal&rsquo;lated
he was goin&rsquo; on one of them long rides
he took, off&rsquo;n&rsquo; on, hunting for Bodil. Wall,
arter a time, he climbed up, draggin&rsquo; a bag he&rsquo;d
tuk along to put the gold in. He peered into the
rock house door an&rsquo; <i>thar</i> was that eye, jest as
Sven had said, in the wall opposite, an&rsquo; it was
glarin&rsquo; green like a cat&rsquo;s eye in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man stopped talking and swayed his
shaggy head back and forth for a long minute
before he satisfied his listeners&rsquo; curiosity. Dora
found herself clutching Mary&rsquo;s hand but
neither of them spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The nex&rsquo; day,&rdquo; the old man continued,
&ldquo;cowboys ridin&rsquo; out on the road heerd
screamin&rsquo;. Then it stopped an&rsquo; they couldn&rsquo;t
place it nohow. Arter a time they heerd it agin.
Thinkin&rsquo; as how Lucky Loon was hurt mabbe,
they rode in through his gate an&rsquo; found that
young tenderfoot fellar writhin&rsquo; around at the
foot o&rsquo; the cliff. He was paralyzed, sure sartin,
an&rsquo; arter he&rsquo;d tol&rsquo; about seein&rsquo; that thar turquoise
eye, he give up the ghost. <i>That</i> much is
true. They fetched the tenderfoot fellar in here
to my store an&rsquo; I seen the wild, skeered look in
his eyes. Wall, arter that, Sven Pedersen
didn&rsquo;t have no more need to worry about his
house bein&rsquo; robbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-o-o! I should think not.&rdquo; Mary shuddered,
then she glanced at her wrist watch,
thinking that they ought to go. Nine o&rsquo;clock,
and Mr. Harvey&rsquo;s store was always dark before
that. They were keeping him up, but before
she could suggest leaving, she heard Dora
asking still another question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Harvey, when did poor Mr. Lucky
Loon die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was actually a startled expression in
the deeply sunken eyes of the old man. He
turned in his chair and looked up at Jerry.
After all, he had <i>not</i> forgotten the boys. In an
awed voice he asked: &ldquo;Jerry, did yo&rsquo; ever hear
tell how old Sven Pedersen give up the ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall cowboy shook his head. &ldquo;No, Mr.
Harvey. I&rsquo;ve asked Dad but he said it was a
mystery that he reckoned never would be
solved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t never any mystery to <i>me</i>,&rdquo; the
old man told them, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d been swore to
secrecy. Sven Pedersen said he&rsquo;d come back an&rsquo;
hant my store if I ever tol&rsquo;, but I reckon thar&rsquo;s
no sech thing as hants. Anyhow I ain&rsquo;t never
<i>seen a</i> ghost, though thar <i>is</i> folks as calls this
here town hanted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>Mary turned startled eyes around to question
Jerry. That boy said seriously, &ldquo;Mr. Harvey,
we&rsquo;d like awfully well to know what happened
to Mr. Pedersen, but we wouldn&rsquo;t want
your store to be haunted if you believe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>don&rsquo;</i> believe nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the sort.&rdquo; The old
man seemed to scorn the inference. Turning, he
beckoned to the boys. &ldquo;Stan&rsquo; up close, sort o&rsquo;.
I won&rsquo;t tell it loud; than mabbe it won&rsquo;t be
heern by nobody but you-uns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry stood close back of Mary&rsquo;s chair. Dick
sat on his heels next to Dora. The wind that
had rattled loose boards had gone down. Not a
sound was to be heard. The fire in the stove
had burned to ashes. The room was getting
cold but the girls did not notice. With wide,
almost startled eyes they were watching the old
man who was again chewing on an end of his
gray beard.</p>
<p>Suddenly he cupped an ear with one palsied
hand and seemed to be listening intently. Mary
clutched Dora&rsquo;s arm. She expected the old man
to ask them if they heard a gun shot, but he
didn&rsquo;t. He dropped his arm and commenced in
a matter-of-fact tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fer the las&rsquo; year o&rsquo; his life, Sven Pedersen
give up minin&rsquo;. He reckoned as how he&rsquo;d never
find his sister an&rsquo; he&rsquo;d jest been pilin&rsquo; up
wealth to give to her, he sed. He used to spec&rsquo;late
about poor Bodil a lot. She&rsquo;d be a young
woman now, he&rsquo;d say, sad like, <i>if</i> them bandits
let her live. Then thar was times when he&rsquo;d
hope she&rsquo;d died ruther than be fetched up by
robbers. He didn&rsquo;t talk much about anythin&rsquo;
else. Folks never knew whar he went to do his
buyin&rsquo;; thot as how he&rsquo;d go off to Bisbee, but
&rsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t so. He come here arter midnight so&rsquo;s
not to be seen. He tol&rsquo; me if, chance be, Bodil
was alive an&rsquo; showed up arter he was dead, he
wanted her to have his gold. He writ a letter
in that furrin tongue o&rsquo; his an&rsquo; give it to me.
I got it yit. In it he tol&rsquo; Bodil <i>whar</i> he&rsquo;d got
his fortin hid.&rdquo; The old man paused and
blinked his eyes hard.</p>
<p>Mary asked softly, &ldquo;But she never came, did
she, Mr. Harvey? That poor Little Bodil with
the china-blue eyes and the corn-silk hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she never come, an&rsquo; I cal&rsquo;late she never
will. Lucky Loon didn&rsquo;t reckon she would,
really, but he hung on till he felt death comin&rsquo;.
Then he tol&rsquo; me what he was a plannin&rsquo; to do
to hisself.&rdquo; The old man glanced anxiously
at Jerry, who stood with his hands on Mary&rsquo;s
shoulders. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mighty gruesome story, the
rest o&rsquo; it, Jerry lad. Do you reckon it&rsquo;d better
be tol&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>It was Dora who replied, &ldquo;Oh, <i>please</i>, Mr.
Harvey! We girls aren&rsquo;t a mite scary. It&rsquo;s
only a story to us, you know. It all happened
so long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, as I was sayin&rsquo;, Sven Pedersen knew
he hadn&rsquo;t long to live, so one night thar was a
blizzard threatenin&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; it turned into as bad
a one as when he furst blowed into my store
years back. Whar was I?&rdquo; He looked blankly
at Mary who prompted with, &ldquo;So one night
when he felt that he was soon to die&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sven come to me an&rsquo; swore me to keep it
secret what he was goin&rsquo; to do. He sed that
back of his house an&rsquo; opening into it, he had a
vault. He&rsquo;d jest left room for hisself to creep
into it. Then he was goin&rsquo; to wall it up, an&rsquo; lay
hisself down an&rsquo; die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how terrible!&rdquo; Dora exclaimed.
&ldquo;Surely he didn&rsquo;t <i>do</i> that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man sighed. &ldquo;Fur as I know he did.
I seen as how he was white as a ghost an&rsquo;
coughin&rsquo; suthin&rsquo; awful. I tol&rsquo; him to stay at
the store till the blizzard blew over. It commonly
lasted three days, but out he went an&rsquo;
I never seen him sence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Lucky Loon!&rdquo; Mary said commiseratingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; poor Little Bodil,&rdquo; Dora began, when
she glanced at the old man who had suddenly
sat erect, staring into a dark corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Harvey,&rdquo; Mary whispered, &ldquo;<i>do</i>
you see that ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>They all looked and saw a flickering light.
Then Jerry, glancing up at the hanging lamp,
saw that the kerosene had burned out. One
more flicker and the store was in darkness.
Mary screamed and clung to Jerry, but Dora,
remembering her flash, turned it on.</p>
<p>Dick, matter-of-factly, glanced about, saw the
oil can, pulled down the lamp, refilled it, and
relighted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank ye! Thank ye!&rdquo; the old man said.
&ldquo;I reckon that&rsquo;s about all thar is to hants anyhow.
I never had no reason to believe in ghosts
an&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to start in now. Wall, must
yo&rsquo; be goin&rsquo;? Drop in tomorrer an&rsquo; ef I kin
find it, I&rsquo;ll show yo&rsquo; that yellar ol&rsquo; letter Lucky
Loon left fer his gal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br />MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>It was midnight when Mary Moore awoke
with a start and sat up, staring about her wild-eyed.
&ldquo;Where am I? Where am I?&rdquo; her terrorized
cry, low though it was, wakened Dora,
who, sitting up, caught her friend in a close
embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; she whispered reassuringly,
&ldquo;Mary, you&rsquo;re here with me. We&rsquo;re in bed in
your very own room. Did you have a nightmare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the dim starlight, Dora saw how pale and
startled was the face of her friend. Mary&rsquo;s big
blue eyes looked about the room wildly as
though she expected to see someone lurking in
the dark corners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one here,&rdquo; Dora assured her.
&ldquo;See, I&rsquo;ll prove it to you.&rdquo; She reached for
her flash which she had left on a small table
near her head. The round disc of light danced
from corner to corner of the dark room. The
pale blue muslin curtains, waving in the breeze
at open windows, <i>looked</i> like ghosts, perhaps
but Mary knew what they were. Still she was
not satisfied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dora,&rdquo; she whispered, clinging to her
friend&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;are you sure the window at the
top of the outside stairway is locked? Terribly
sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. I locked it the last thing, but I&rsquo;ll
get up and see.&rdquo; Dora slipped out of bed and
crossed the room. The long door-like window
was securely fastened. The other two windows
were open at the top only. No one could possibly
have entered that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try the hall door,&rdquo; Mary pleaded, &ldquo;and
would you mind, awfully, if I asked you to look
in the clothes closet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora had no sense of fear as she was convinced
that Mary had been dreaming some wild
thing, and she didn&rsquo;t much wonder, after the
gruesome story they had heard the night
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, are you satisfied?&rdquo; Dora climbed
back into bed and replaced the flash on the
table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I am.&rdquo; Mary permitted herself
to be covered again with the downy blue quilt.
&ldquo;But it did seem so terribly real, and yet, now
that I come to think, it didn&rsquo;t have anything at
all to do with this room. We were in some bleak
place I had never seen before. It was the
queerest dream, Dora. In the beginning you
and I went out all alone for a horseback ride.
The road looked familiar enough. It was just
like the road from Gleeson down to the Douglas
valley highway. We were cantering along, oh,
just as we have lots of times, when suddenly the
scene changed&mdash;you know the way it does in
dreams&mdash;and we were in the wildest kind of a
mountain country. It was terrifyingly lonely.
We couldn&rsquo;t see anything but bleak, grim
mountain ranges rising about us for miles and
miles around. Some of them were so high the
peaks were white with snow. I remember one
peak especially. It looked like a huge woman
ghost with two smaller peaks, like children
ghosts, clinging to her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sand was unearthly white and covered
with human skeletons as though there had been
a battle once long ago. We rode around wildly
trying to find an opening so that we could
escape. Then a terribly uncanny thing happened.
One of those skeletons rose up right
ahead of us and pointed directly toward that
mountain with the three ghost-like snow-covered
peaks. But our horses wouldn&rsquo;t go
that way, they were terrorized when they saw
that hollow-eyed skeleton, waving his bony
arms in front of them. They reared&mdash;then
whirled around and galloped so fast we were
both of us thrown off and <i>that&rsquo;s</i> when I woke
up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious goodness,&rdquo; Dora exclaimed with
a shudder. &ldquo;That <i>was</i> a nightmare! For
cricket&rsquo;s sakes, let&rsquo;s talk about something pleasant
so that when you go to sleep again, you
won&rsquo;t have another such <i>awful</i> dream. Now,
let me see, <i>what</i> shall we talk about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Dora,&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s voice was
tense with emotion, &ldquo;I keep wondering and
wondering about that poor Little Bodil. If she
were carried off by a robber, <i>what</i> do you suppose
he would do with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it all depends on what kind of a bandit
he was,&rdquo; Dora said matter-of-factly. &ldquo;If
he were a good robber like Robin Hood, he
would have sent her away to a boarding-school
somewhere to be educated, since she was only
ten years old. Then he would have reformed,
and when she was sixteen and very beautiful
with her china-blue eyes and corn-silk-yellow
hair, he would have married her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How I do hope something like that <i>did</i>
happen.&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s voice sounded more natural,
the tenseness and terror were gone, so Dora
kept on, &ldquo;I think they probably bought a ranch
in&mdash;er&mdash;some beautiful valley in Mexico, or
some remote place where Robin Hood wouldn&rsquo;t
be known and lived happily ever after.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if they had any children.&rdquo; Mary
spoke as though she really believed that Dora
was unraveling the mystery. &ldquo;If they had a
boy and a girl, suppose, they would be our age
since poor Bodil would be about fifty years old
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora laughed. &ldquo;Well, we probably never will
know what became of that poor little Danish
girl so we might as well accept my theory as
any other. Let&rsquo;s try to sleep now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary was silent for several moments, and
Dora was just deciding that her services as a
pacifier were over and that she might try to
go to sleep herself, when Mary whispered,
&ldquo;Dodo, do <i>you</i> believe that story about the Evil
Eye Turquoise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora sighed softly. Here was another subject
with scary possibilities. &ldquo;Well, not
exactly,&rdquo; she acknowledged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt but
that the thieving tenderfoot <i>did</i> fall over the
cliff and <i>was</i> paralyzed, because he hit his head
against a rock or something, but I think it was
his own fear of the Evil Eye Turquoise which
made him fall and not any demon power the
eye really had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, that <i>does</i> seem sensible,&rdquo; Mary
agreed. Again she was quiet and this time
Dora was really dozing when she heard in a
shuddery voice, &ldquo;Oh-oo, Dora, I do try awfully
hard to keep from thinking of that poor Sven
Pedersen after he&rsquo;d walled himself into his
tomb and lay down to die. What if he lived a
long time. I&rsquo;ve read about people being buried
alive and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Blue Moons, Mary! What awful things you
do think about!&rdquo; Dora was a bit provoked. She
was really sleepy, and thought she had earned
a good rest for the remaining hours of the
night. &ldquo;Lots of animals creep away into far
corners of dark caves when they know they&rsquo;re
going to die. That&rsquo;s better than lying around
helpless somewhere, and have wolves tearing
you to pieces or vultures swirling around over
you, dropping lower and lower, waiting for you
to take your last breath. For my part, I think
Sven Pedersen did a very sensible thing. In
that way he was sure of a decent burial. Now,
Mary dear, much as I love you, if you so much
as peep again tonight, I&rsquo;m going to take my
pillow and go into the spare front bedroom and
leave you all to your lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark! What was that noise? Didn&rsquo;t it
sound to you like rattling bones?&rdquo; Again Mary
clutched her friend&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>Dora gave up. &ldquo;Sort of,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;The
wind is rising again.&rdquo; Then she made one more
desperate effort to lead Mary&rsquo;s thoughts into
pleasanter channels. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great fun
if Polly and Patsy could come West while we&rsquo;re
here?&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;I wonder how Jerry and
Dick would like them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How could anyone <i>help</i> liking them? Our
red-headed Pat is so pert and funny, while
roly-poly Poll is so altogether lovable.&rdquo; Mary
was actually smiling as she thought of their
far away pals. Then suddenly she exclaimed,
&ldquo;Dora Bellman, that new friend of Pat&rsquo;s,
Harry Hulbert, you know; he really and truly
is coming West soon, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes!&rdquo; Dora was recalling what Pat
had written. &ldquo;Oh, Mary,&rdquo; she exclaimed with
new interest, &ldquo;when he is a scout, hunting for
bandits and train robbers and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary sat up and seized her friend&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;I
know what you&rsquo;re going to say,&rdquo; she put in
gleefully. &ldquo;This Harry Hulbert <i>may</i> be able
to help solve the mystery of Bodil&rsquo;s disappearance.
But that&rsquo;s too much to hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora laughingly agreed. &ldquo;How wild one&rsquo;s
imagination is in the middle of the night,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Middle of the night,&rdquo; Mary repeated as she
looked out of the nearest window. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
dim light in the East and we haven&rsquo;t had half
of our sleep out yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long-suffering Dora thought, &ldquo;That certainly
isn&rsquo;t <i>my</i> fault.&rdquo; Aloud she said, &ldquo;Well,
let&rsquo;s make up for lost time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nestled down and Mary cuddled close.
Sleepily she had the last word. &ldquo;I hope Harry
Hulbert will come, and&mdash;and&mdash;Pat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>At seven o&rsquo;clock Carmelita&rsquo;s deep, musical
voice called, but there was no answer. The two
sound-asleep girls had not heard. At ten
o&rsquo;clock they were awakened by a low whistling
below their open windows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br />SINGING COWBOYS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Mary sat up in bed,
blinked her eyes hard to get them open, then
leaped out, and, keeping hidden, peeped down
into the door yard. Near the back porch stood
Jerry Newcomb&rsquo;s dilapidated old car, gray
with sand. Two cowboys stood beside it, evidently
more intent upon an examination of the
machinery under the hood than they were of
the house. Although they were whistling, to
attract attention, they pretended to be patiently
waiting. Carmelita had informed Jerry
that the girls still slept.</p>
<p>Mary pirouetted back into the room, her blue
eyes dancing. &ldquo;The boys are going to take us
somewhere, I&rsquo;m just <i>ever</i> so sure,&rdquo; she told the
girl, who, sitting on the side of the bed, was
sleepily yawning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness, <i>why</i> did they come so early?&rdquo;
Dora asked drowsily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early!&rdquo; Mary laughed at her and pointed
at the little blue clock on the curly maple
dresser. &ldquo;Dora Bellman, did you ever sleep so
late before in all your life?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Dora seemed provokingly indifferent
to the fact that the boys waited below,
and that, perhaps, oh, ever so much more than
likely, they were going adventuring. &ldquo;Once,
you remember that time after a school dance
when the boys from the Wales Military
Academy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary skipped over to the bedside and pulled
her friend to her feet. &ldquo;Oh, <i>please</i> do hurry!&rdquo;
she begged. &ldquo;I feel in my bones that the boys
are going somewhere to try to solve the mystery
and that they want to take us with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora&rsquo;s dark eyes stared stupidly, or tried
hard to give that impression. &ldquo;What mystery?&rdquo;
she asked, indifferently, as she began
to dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I refuse to answer.&rdquo; Mary was peering into
the long oval mirror brushing her short golden
curls. Her lovely face was aglow with eager
interest. &ldquo;There is only <i>one</i> mystery that we
are curious about as you know perfectly well
and that is what became of poor Little Bodil
Pedersen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Mary was looking at it, she was not
even conscious of her own fair reflection. She
glanced in the mirror, back at her friend, and
saw her grinning in wicked glee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>Whirling, brush in hand, Mary demanded,
&ldquo;What <i>is</i> so funny, Dora? You aren&rsquo;t acting a
bit natural this morning. What made you grin
that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just happened to think of something. Oh,
maybe it isn&rsquo;t so awfully funny, but it&rsquo;s sort
of uncanny at that. I was thinking that, pretty
as <i>you</i> are on the outside, you&rsquo;ve got a hollow,
staring-eyed skeleton inside of you and that if
I had X-ray eyes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary, with a horrified glance at her teasing
friend, stuffed her fingers into her ears.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re terrible!&rdquo; She shuddered.</p>
<p>Dora contritely caught Mary&rsquo;s hands and
drew them down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belovedest,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just as
thrilled as you are at the prospect of going
buggy riding with two nice cowboys whether
we find poor Little lost Bodil (who is probably
a fat old woman now) or solve any other mystery
that may be lying around loose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary was still pouting. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t sound a
bit like you to pretend&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora rushed in with, &ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s</i> all it is, believe
me! There, now I&rsquo;m dressed, all but topping
off. What do you think we&rsquo;d better wear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s put on our kimonas until we find out
where we&rsquo;re going, then we&rsquo;ll know better <i>what</i>
to wear. Jerry may have an errand over in
Douglas and, if so, we&rsquo;d want to dress up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s Japanese kimona was one of her
treasures. It was heavy blue silk with flowers of
gold trailing all over it. Dora&rsquo;s laughing, olive-tinted
face reflected a glow from her cherry-colored
silk kimona with its border of white
chrysanthemums.</p>
<p>Carmelita, who was in the act of reheating
the breakfast for the girls, who she felt sure
would soon be coming, stared at them open-eyed
and mouthed when she saw them tripping
through the kitchen.</p>
<p>In very uncertain Spanish they called &ldquo;Good
morning&rdquo; to her, then burst upon the boys&rsquo;
astonished vision.</p>
<p>Dick, snatching off his sombrero, held it to
his heart while he made a deep bow. Jerry,
bounding forward, caught Mary&rsquo;s two small
hands in his. Then he held her from him as he
looked at her with the same reverent admiration
that he would have given a rarely lovely
picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know a word of Japanese,&rdquo; Dick
despaired, &ldquo;so how can I make my meaning
clear?&rdquo; His big, dark eyes smiled at Dora,
who gaily retorted, &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know that our
prize costumes would strike you boys dumb. If
we had, we wouldn&rsquo;t have worn them, would
we, Mary?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say not,&rdquo; that little maid replied.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re wild to know <i>why</i> you&rsquo;ve come when
you <i>should</i> be roping steers or mending fences,
if that is what cowboys do in the middle of the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re going to explain our presence all
right. We made it up while we came along&mdash;&rdquo;
Dick began, when Jerry interrupted with, &ldquo;You
girls have heard range-ridin&rsquo; songs, I reckon,
haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; they said together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is, not real ones,&rdquo; Dora explained.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve heard them in the talkies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is a real one all right. Just fresh
from the&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo; Dick glanced sideways at
Jerry who began in a low sing-song voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two cowboys in the middle of the night,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick joined in:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Did their work and they did it right.</p>
<p class="t4">Come, come, coma,</p>
<p class="t4">Coma, coma, kee.</p>
<p class="t4">Coma, coma, coma,</p>
<p class="t5">Kee, kee, kee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Dick with a flourish of the
hand which still held his sombrero, &ldquo;is why we
have time to play today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls had been appreciative listeners.
&ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t there any more to it?&rdquo; Dora cried
&ldquo;I thought cowboy songs went on and on; forty
verses or more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So they do!&rdquo; Jerry agreed. &ldquo;But I reckon
<i>this</i> one is too new to be that long, but there is
another verse,&rdquo; he acknowledged.</p>
<p>Then in a rollicking way they sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Two cowboys who were jolly and gay</p>
<p class="t0">Wished to go adventuring the next day.</p>
<p class="t4">Come, come, coma,</p>
<p class="t4">Coma, coma, kee.</p>
<p class="t4">Coma, coma, coma,</p>
<p class="t5">Kee, kee, kee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then, acting out the words by a little strutting,
they sang lustily:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Two cowboys who were brave and bold</p>
<p class="t0">Took two girls in a rattletrap old.</p>
<p class="t4">Come, come, coma,</p>
<p class="t4">Coma, coma, kee.</p>
<p class="t4">And that&rsquo;s <i>all</i> of it</p>
<p class="t5">If you&rsquo;ll come with me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Dick bowed to Dora and Jerry beamed upon
Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Happy Days! We&rsquo;re keen to go,&rdquo; Dora
told them, &ldquo;but <i>where</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer was another sing-song:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The two cowboys were on mystery bent.</p>
<p class="t0">They went somewhere, but <i>you&rsquo;ll</i> know where they went</p>
<p class="t4">If you&rsquo;ll come, come, coma,</p>
<p class="t4">Come in our old &rsquo;bus,</p>
<p class="t4">Come, come, coma,</p>
<p class="t5"><i>Come with us</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>Carmelita, who had appeared in the kitchen
door, started chattering in Spanish and Jerry
laughingly translated, rather freely, and not
quite as the truly deferential cook had intended.
&ldquo;Carmelita asks me to tell you girls
that she has reheated your breakfast for the
last time and that if you don&rsquo;t come in now and
eat it, she&rsquo;s going to give it to the cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; Mary pointed an accusing finger at
him. &ldquo;I <i>know</i> you are making it up. Carmelita
wouldn&rsquo;t have said that, because there <i>is</i> no
cat.&rdquo; Then graciously, she added, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you
singing cowboys come in and have a cup of
coffee, if there is any?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry asked Carmelita if there was enough
of a snack for two starved cowboys who had
breakfasted at daybreak and that good-natured
Mexican woman declared that there was batter
enough to make stacks more cakes if Jerry
wanted to fry them. <i>She</i> had butter to churn
down in the cooling cellar.</p>
<p>Mary insisted that she be the one to fry the
cakes, but Jerry and Dick insisted equally,
that she should not, dressed up like a Japanese
princess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grease spatters wouldn&rsquo;t look well tangled
up in that gold vine,&rdquo; Jerry told her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>With skill and despatch, Jerry flipped cakes
and Dick served them. Then, while the girls
went upstairs to don their hiking suits with the
short divided skirts, the boys ate small mountains
of the cakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verse five!&rdquo; Dick mumbled with his mouth
full.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Two cowboys with a big appetite</p>
<p class="t0">They could eat flapjacks all day and all night.</p>
<p class="t4">Come, come, coma,</p>
<p class="t4">Coma, coma, kee.</p>
<p class="t4">Those cowboys, Jerry,</p>
<p class="t5">Are You and me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Back of them a laughing voice chanted,
&ldquo;Verse six.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Two cowgirls are ready for a lark.</p>
<p class="t0">Oho-ho, so let us embark.</p>
<p class="t4">Come, come, coma,</p>
<p class="t4">Coma, coma, kee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Dick and Jerry sprang up and joined the
chorus with:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll coma, coma, coma</p>
<p class="t0">With glee, glee, glee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br />A VAGABOND FAMILY</h2>
<p>Jerry assisted Mary up onto the front
seat without question, then slipped in under
the wheel. Dora climbed nimbly to her customary
place in the rumble. Dick leaped in beside
her. His frank, friendly smile told his
pleasure in her companionship.</p>
<p>Dora&rsquo;s happy smile, equally frank and
friendly, preceded her eager question, &ldquo;Where
are we going, Dick? I&rsquo;m bursting with curiosity.
Of course I know it&rsquo;s some sort of a
picnic.&rdquo; She nodded toward the covered
hamper at their feet. &ldquo;But, surely there&rsquo;s more
to it than just a lark. You boys wouldn&rsquo;t have
worked all night, if you really did, that you
might just play today, would you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick leaned toward his companion and said
in a low voice, &ldquo;Shh! It&rsquo;s a dire secret! We
are on a mysterious mission bent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora laughed at his caution. &ldquo;This car of
Jerry&rsquo;s makes so many rattling noises, we
could shout and not be heard. But do stop
&lsquo;nonsensing,&rsquo; as my grandfather used to say,
and reveal all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>Dick sobered at once. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s this way. Last night, after we left you
girls, Jerry was telling me about a family of
poor squatters, as we&rsquo;d call them back East.
Some months ago they came from no one knows
where, in an old rattletrap wagon drawn by a
bony white horse. Jerry was riding fences near
the highway when they passed. He said he
never had seen such a forlorn looking outfit.
The wagon was hung all over with pots and
pans, a washtub, and, oh, you know, the absolute
necessities of life. In the wagon, on the
front seat, was a woman so thin and pale Jerry
knew she must be almost dead with the white
plague. She had a baby girl in her lap. The
father, Jerry said, had a look in his eyes that
would haunt the hardest-hearted criminal. It
was a gentle-desperate expression, if you get
what I mean. Two boys about ten sat in the
back of the wagon, hollow-eyed skeletons,
covered with sickly yellow skin, while seated
on a low chair in the wagon was an older girl
staring straight ahead of her in a wild sort of
a way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor things!&rdquo; Dora exclaimed when
Dick paused. &ldquo;What became of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the outfit stopped near where Jerry
was riding and the man hailed him. &lsquo;Friend,&rsquo;
he called, &lsquo;is there anywhere we could get
water for our horse? It&rsquo;s most petered out.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry told them that about a mile, straight
ahead, they would find a side road leading
toward the mountains. If they would turn
there, they would come to a rushing stream.
They could have all the water they wished. And
then, Jerry said, feeling so terribly sorry for
them, he added on an impulse, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a
herder&rsquo;s shack close by. Stay all night in it if
you want. It&rsquo;s my father&rsquo;s land and you&rsquo;re
welcome.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora turned an eager face toward the
speaker. &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I believe I can tell
you what happened next. That poor family
stayed all night in that herder&rsquo;s shack and they
<i>never left</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick nodded. &ldquo;Are you a mind reader?&rdquo; he
asked, his big, dark eyes smiling at her through
the shell-rimmed glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o. I don&rsquo;t believe that I am.&rdquo; Then
eagerly, &ldquo;But <i>do</i> tell me what <i>possible</i> connection
that poor family can have with this expedition
of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that like a girl?&rdquo; Dick teased. &ldquo;You
want to hear the last chapter, before you know
what happened to lead up to it. I&rsquo;ll return to
the morning after. Jerry said he had thought
of the family all the afternoon, and that night
when he got home, he told his mother, who, as
you know, has a heart of gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dick!&rdquo; Dora interrupted. &ldquo;Gold may
be precious, but it isn&rsquo;t as tender and kind,
always, as the heart of Jerry&rsquo;s mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be that as it may,&rdquo; the boy continued,
&ldquo;Mrs. Newcomb packed a hamper&mdash;this very
one now reposing at our feet, I suppose&mdash;with
all manner of good things and she had Jerry
harness up as soon as he&rsquo;d eaten and take her
to call on their unexpected guests. They found
the woman lying on the one mattress, coughing
pitifully, and the others gazing at her, the little
ones frightened, and huddled, the older girl on
her knees rubbing her mother&rsquo;s hands. The
father stood looking down with such despair in
his eyes, Mrs. Newcomb said, as she had never
before seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;d ought to be a doctor here,&rsquo; she
said at once, but the woman on the mattress
smiled up at her feebly and shook her head.
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going on now,&rsquo; she said in a low voice,
&lsquo;and I&rsquo;d go on gladly,&mdash;I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> tired&mdash;if I knew
my children had a roof over their heads and&mdash;and&mdash;,&rsquo;
then a fit of coughing came. When it
passed, the woman lay looking up at Jerry&rsquo;s
mother, her dim eyes pleading, and Mrs. Newcomb
knelt beside her and took her almost lifeless
hand and said, &lsquo;Do not worry, dear friend,
your children shall have a roof over their
heads and food.&rsquo; Then the mother smiled at her
loved ones, closed her eyes and went on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>There were tears in Dora&rsquo;s eyes, and she
frankly wiped them away with her handkerchief.
Unashamed, Dick said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just how
I felt when Jerry told me about the Dooleys.
That&rsquo;s their name. Of course, Mrs. Newcomb
kept her word. That little shack is in a lovely
spot near the stream with big cottonwood trees
around it. After the funeral, Mr. Newcomb
told the father that he and the boys could cut
down some of the small cottonwoods upstream,
leaving every third one, and build another
room, so they put up a lean-to. Then he gave
them a cow to milk and the boys started a vegetable
garden. Mr. Dooley does odd jobs on the
ranch, though he isn&rsquo;t strong enough for hard
riding, and the girl Etta mothers the baby and
the little boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have we reached that last chapter?&rdquo; Dora
asked. &ldquo;The one I was trying to hear before
we got to it? In other words, may I now know
how this terribly tragic story links up with our
today&rsquo;s adventuring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure may,&rdquo; Dick said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way.
The Newcombs, generous as they have been,
can&rsquo;t afford to keep those children clothed and
fed. Moreover they ought to go to school next
fall and between now and then, some money
<i>must</i> be found and so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh! I see!&rdquo; Dora glowed at him.
&ldquo;Jerry thinks that it is a cruel shame to have
this poor family in desperate need when Mr.
Lucky Loon has a tomb full of gold helping no
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick smiled. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m <i>sure</i> you&rsquo;re a mind
reader. Although,&rdquo; he corrected, &ldquo;Jerry didn&rsquo;t
just put it that way. But what he <i>did</i> say was
that if we could find out definitely that Bodil
Pedersen is dead and that there is no one else
to claim that buried treasure, perhaps the old
storekeeper, Mr. Silas Harvey, <i>might</i> give us
the letter he has, telling where it is hidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Jerry think the money might be used
for that poor family?&rdquo; Dora asked.</p>
<p>Dick nodded. &ldquo;He did, if Mr. Harvey consented.
Jerry feels, and so do I, that if Bodil
Pedersen hasn&rsquo;t turned up in thirty years, she
probably never will. Of course it would be by
the merest chance that she would drift into
this isolated mountain town, anyway, even if
she <i>is</i> alive, which Jerry thinks is very doubtful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora was thoughtful for a moment. &ldquo;Did
Mr. Pedersen advertise in the papers for his
lost sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wondered about that and this morning
we asked Mr. Newcomb. He said he distinctly
remembered the story in the Douglas paper,
and that afterwards it was copied all over the
state.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; Dora suddenly ejaculated as
she glanced about her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so terribly
interested in that poor family, I hardly noticed
where we were going. We&rsquo;ve crossed the desert
road and here we are right at the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How bleak and grim this range is,&rdquo; Dick
said, then, turning to look back across the
desert valley to a low wooded range in the
purple distance, he added, &ldquo;<i>Those</i> mountains
across there, where the Newcomb ranch is, are
lots more friendly and likeable, aren&rsquo;t they?
They seem to have pleasant things to tell about
their past, but these mountains&mdash;&rdquo; the boy
paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know.&rdquo; Dora actually shuddered.
&ldquo;These seem cruel as though they <i>wanted</i>
people who tried to cross over them to die of
thirst, or to be hurled over their precipices,
or&mdash;&rdquo; suddenly her tone became one of alarm.
&ldquo;Dick, did <i>you</i> know we were going up into
these <i>awful</i> mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her companion nodded, his expression serious.
&ldquo;Yes, I knew it,&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;but I
also know that Jerry wouldn&rsquo;t take us up here
if he weren&rsquo;t sure that we&rsquo;d be safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Dora agreed, &ldquo;but wow! isn&rsquo;t
the road narrow and rutty, and <i>are</i> we going
straight up?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>Dick laughed, for the girl, unconsciously, had
clutched his khaki-covered arm. &ldquo;If those are
questions needing answers,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
say, <i>Believe me</i>, yes. Ha, here&rsquo;s a place wide
enough for a car to pass. Jerry&rsquo;s stopping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the rattling of the little old car was
stilled, Jerry and Mary turned and smiled back
at the other two. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be scared, Dora,&rdquo;
Mary called. &ldquo;Jerry says that no one ever
crosses this old road now. It&rsquo;s been abandoned
since the valley highway was built.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; The cowboy&rsquo;s cheerful voice
assured the two in back that he was in no way
alarmed. &ldquo;I reckoned we&rsquo;d let our &lsquo;tin Cayuse&rsquo;
rest a bit and get his breath before we do the
cliff-climbing stunt that&rsquo;s waitin&rsquo; us just
around this curve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora thought, &ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s just as scared as I
am. I <i>know</i> she is. She&rsquo;s white as a ghost,
but she doesn&rsquo;t want Jerry to think she doesn&rsquo;t
trust him to take care of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick broke in with, &ldquo;Say, when does this
outfit eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine idea!&rdquo; Jerry agreed heartily. &ldquo;Dora,
open up the grub box and hand it around, will
you? I reckon we&rsquo;ll need fortifyin&rsquo; for what&rsquo;s
going to happen next.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X
<br />A LONELY MOUNTAIN ROAD</h2>
<p>While the four young people ate the delicious
chicken sandwiches which Mrs. Newcomb
had prepared for them and drank creamy milk
poured into aluminum cups from a big thermos
bottle, they sat gazing silently about them, awed
by the terrific majesty of the scene, the girls
not entirely unafraid. Below them was a sheer
drop of hundreds of feet to a desert floor
which was most uneven, having been cut up by
torrents, which, during each heavy rain, were
hurled down the mountain sides.</p>
<p>The effect of the desert for miles beyond was
that of a little &ldquo;Grand Canyon.&rdquo; Dora,
thoughtfully gazing at it, said,&mdash;&ldquo;In a few
centuries, other girls and boys will stand here,
perhaps, and by <i>that</i> time those canyons will
be worn deep as the real Grand Canyon is today,
won&rsquo;t they, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; the cowboy replied.</p>
<p>Then Mary asked, &ldquo;Jerry, is this old dangerous
mountain road the <i>very</i> same one that the
stages used to cross years ago?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>Jerry nodded, but before he could speak,
Mary, shining-eyed, rushed on with, &ldquo;Oh, Dora,
I <i>know</i> why the boys have brought us here!
<i>This</i> is the road where the three bandits held
up the stage that Sven Pedersen and poor
Little Bodil were riding in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is!&rdquo; Dora generously refrained
from telling her friend that she had been convinced
of <i>that</i> fact ever since they began climbing
the grade.</p>
<p>Glowing blue eyes turned toward the cowboy.
&ldquo;Oh, Jerry, have you any idea where the
exact spot was; where the bandits shot the
driver, I mean, and where the horses plunged
over the cliff and where that poor little girl
was thrown out into the road?&rdquo; Excitement had
made her breathless.</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s admiring gray eyes smiled down at
the eagerly chattering girl. &ldquo;I reckon I know
close to the spot. Silas Harvey said it was just
at the top of Devil&rsquo;s Drop, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary interrupted, horror in her tone, &ldquo;Oh,
Jerry, <i>what</i> a dreadful name! <i>What</i> is it?
<i>Where</i> is it?&rdquo; She was gazing about, her eyes
startled. The road disappeared fifty feet ahead
of them around a sharp curve. For answer
Jerry started the motor, then, joltingly and
with cautious slowness, the small car crept
toward the curve. Unconsciously the girls were
almost holding their breath as they gazed unblinkingly
out of staring eyes at the wall of
rock around which the road was winding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>When they saw &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Drop,&rdquo; a bare,
granite peak, up the near side of which the old
road climbed at an angle which seemed but
slightly off the perpendicular, Mary, with a
little half sob, covered her eyes.</p>
<p>Jerry, terribly self-rebuking, wished sincerely
that he and Dick had come alone. He
was sure that the road was safe, for he and his
father had crossed it since the last heavy rain.
Mr. Newcomb had a mining claim which could
be reached by no other road. So it was with
confidence that Jerry tried to allay Mary&rsquo;s
fears. &ldquo;Little Sister,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;please trust
me when I tell you that the grade <i>looks</i> a lot
worse than it is. I&rsquo;d turn back if I could, but
it wouldn&rsquo;t be safe to try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary, ashamed of her momentary lack of
faith in Jerry&rsquo;s good judgment, put down her
hands and smiled up into his anxious face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to shut my
eyes tight until we are up top. You tell me,
won&rsquo;t you, when the worst is over?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>Dora had made no sound, but Dick, glancing
at her, saw that she was staring down at the
hamper at her feet as though she saw something
there that fascinated her. He, also, feared
that the girls should have been left at home.
Nor was he himself altogether fearless. Having
spent his boyhood in and around Boston, he
was unused to perilous mountain rides and he
was glad when the car came to a jolting stop
and Jerry&rsquo;s voice, relief evident in its tone,
sang out, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re up top, and all the rest of
our ride will be going down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary opened her eyes and saw that the road
had widened on what seemed to be a large
ledge. Jerry climbed out and put huge stones
in front and back of the wheels, then he held
out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where we start hunting for clues,&rdquo;
he said, smiling, but at the same time scanning
his companion&rsquo;s face hoping that all traces of
fear had vanished.</p>
<p>Dora and Dick went to the outer edge of the
road. &ldquo;Such a view!&rdquo; Dora cried, flinging her
arms wide to take in the magnitude of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Describe it, who can?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try!&rdquo; Dick replied. &ldquo;A bleak, barren,
cruel desert lay miles below them like a naked,
bony skeleton of sand and rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary, clinging to the cowboy&rsquo;s arm, joined
the others but kept well back from the edge.
&ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; she said in an awed voice, &ldquo;do you
think&mdash;was this the very spot, do you suppose,
where the stage was held up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon so,&rdquo; Jerry replied, &ldquo;as near as I
could figure out from what Silas Harvey said.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>Dora turned. &ldquo;Then somewhere along here
was where poor Little Bodil was thrown into
the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cowboy nodded. A saw-tooth peak rose
just beyond them.</p>
<p>Dora, gazing at it, speculated aloud: &ldquo;<i>Could</i>
a wild beast have slunk around the curve there
snatched the child and dashed away with it to
its cave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll probably never know,&rdquo; Dick replied.
&ldquo;That could have happened, couldn&rsquo;t it
Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon so,&rdquo; the cowboy began, when Mary
caught his arm again. &ldquo;Oh, Jerry,&rdquo; she cried,
&ldquo;<i>are</i> there wild animals now&mdash;I mean living
here in these mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cowboy glanced at Dick before he replied.
&ldquo;None, Little Sister, that will hurt <i>you</i>.
Don&rsquo;t think about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mary persisted. &ldquo;At least <i>tell me</i> what
wild animal lives around here that might have
dragged Little Bodil to its lair.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>Jerry, realizing that there was nothing else
to do, said in as indifferent a tone as he could,
&ldquo;I reckon there <i>may</i> be a mountain lion or so
up here, and a puma perhaps. That&rsquo;s sort of
a big cat, but <i>it&rsquo;s</i> a coward all right! Gets away
every time if it can.&rdquo; He hoped that would
satisfy Mary but instead she looked up at the
grim peak above them, her eyes startled,
searching. &ldquo;I saw a picture once, oh, I remember
it was in my biology book, of a huge catlike
creature crouched on a ledge. It was
about to spring on a goat that was on the mountain
below it. Underneath the picture was
printed, &lsquo;The Puma springs from ledges down
upon its unsuspecting prey.&rsquo; I remember it because
it both fascinated and terrorized me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; the cowboy took both her hands and
smiled into her wide blue eyes, &ldquo;will it make
you feel better about wild animals attacking
us if I tell you that Dick and I are both carrying
concealed weapons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary smiled up at Jerry as she said, &ldquo;You
think I&rsquo;m a silly, I <i>know</i> you do, and I don&rsquo;t
blame you. I&rsquo;m not going to be fearful of anything
again today.&rdquo; Then, as she glanced down
the steep road up which they had come, she returned
the conversation to the subject from
which they had so far digressed. &ldquo;Jerry, which
way do you suppose the three bandits came?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon they came around the sharp curve
over there. They could hide and not be seen
by the driver of the stage until he was almost
upon them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anxiously Mary asked, &ldquo;There wouldn&rsquo;t be
any bandits on <i>this</i> road <i>these</i> days, would
there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>It was Dora who answered, &ldquo;Mary Moore,
you <i>know</i> there wouldn&rsquo;t be. Jerry told us that
this road is abandoned by practically all travelers.&rdquo;
Then turning to the cowboy, Dora excitedly
exclaimed, &ldquo;Why, Jerry, if <i>this</i> is the
spot where the stage was held up and where
the horses plunged off the road, don&rsquo;t you think
it&rsquo;s possible <i>something</i> may be left of the stage,
something that <i>we</i> could find?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I reckoned,&rdquo; the cowboy said
slowly. &ldquo;Dick and I were planning to climb
down the side of the cliff here and see what we
could unearth, but I reckon we&rsquo;d better give
up and go home. Dick, you and I can come
back some other time&mdash;alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Dora pleaded. &ldquo;Mary and I are
all over being afraid. We have on our divided
skirts, and, if it&rsquo;s safe for you to climb down
Devil&rsquo;s Drop, why, it&rsquo;s safe for us, isn&rsquo;t it,
Mary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Jerry says so,&rdquo; was the trusting reply
accompanied by an equally trusting glance
from sweet blue eyes.</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Jerry beckoned Dick
over to the edge of the steep drop. It was not
a sheer descent. Every few feet down there
was a narrow ledge, almost like uneven stairs.
There were scrubby growths in crevices to
which the girls could cling. About one hundred
feet down there was a wide-flung ledge and then
another descent, how perilous that was they
could not discern from where they stood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We could get the girls down to that first
wide ledge easily enough,&rdquo; Dick said, &ldquo;if you
think we ought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry spoke in a low voice which, the girls
could not hear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly sorry we brought
them. My plan was to have them sit in the car
up here in the road while we went down to hunt
for a skeleton of that old stage coach, but now
that Mary&rsquo;s afraid of a wild animal attacking
them, we just can&rsquo;t leave them alone. They
don&rsquo;t either of them know how to use a gun.
I reckon what we <i>ought</i> to do is go back home
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick shook his head. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t let us
now,&rdquo; he said, and he was right, for the girls,
tired of waiting, skipped toward them saying
in a sing-song, &ldquo;Verse seven!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>Two</i> cowgirls whom <i>nothing</i> can stop</p>
<p class="t0">Are now going over the Devil&rsquo;s Drop.</p>
<p class="t4">Come, come, coma,</p>
<p class="t4">Coma, coma, kee.</p>
<p class="t4">You may come along if</p>
<p class="t5">You&rsquo;re brave as we.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; Dick laughed, applauding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, only down as far as the wide ledge,&rdquo;
Jerry told them. &ldquo;That will be easy going, I
reckon, and safe.&rdquo; He held out his strong
brown hand to Mary, and, leading the way, he
began the descent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br />THE SKELETON STAGE COACH</h2>
<p>Mary, slender, light of foot, sprang like a
gazelle from step to step feeling safe, since
Jerry towered in front of her. The firm clasp
of his big hand on her small white one made
her feel protected and cared for and she was
really enjoying the adventure.</p>
<p>Dora, athletic of build and sure-footed, refused
Dick&rsquo;s proffered aid, depending on the
scraggly growths in the crevices for support
until they reached a spot where only prickly-pear
cactus grew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Independent,&rdquo; Dick laughingly
called up to her, &ldquo;you would better put one
hand on my shoulder and let me be your human
staff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This plan proved successful until, in the descent,
they came to a spot where the ledge
below was farther than the girls could step.
Jerry held up his arms and lifted Mary down.
That was not a difficult feat since she was but
a featherweight. Dora, broad shouldered for a
girl and heavily built, was more of a problem.
The boys finally made steps for her, Jerry
offering his shoulders and Dick his bent back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>Dora, flushed, excited, glanced at the ledge
above as she exclaimed, &ldquo;Getting up again will
be even more difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t cross bridges until we get to
them,&rdquo; Dick began, then added, &ldquo;or climb
mountains either. Going down at present requires
our entire attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the narrow ledge-steps continued to be
accommodatingly close for about fifteen feet;
then another sheer descent was covered by repeating
their former tactics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now we&rsquo;re on the wide ledge,&rdquo; Mary
said, &ldquo;and we can&rsquo;t see a single thing that&rsquo;s beneath
us.&rdquo; Then she cried out as a sudden
alarming thought came to her. &ldquo;Oh, Jerry,
<i>what</i> if our weight should cause a rock-slide, or
whatever it&rsquo;s called, and we all were plunged&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull in on fancy&rsquo;s rein, Little Sister!&rdquo; the
cowboy begged. &ldquo;You may be sure I examined
the formation of this ledge before I lifted you
down upon it.&rdquo; Then, turning to Dora, he said,
&ldquo;I reckon you and Mary&rsquo;d better stay close to
the mountain while Dick and I worm ourselves,
Indian fashion, to the very edge where
we can see what&rsquo;s down below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto!&rdquo; Dora slipped an arm about Mary
and together they stood and watched the boys
lying face downward and wriggling their long
bodies over the flat, stone ledge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>Dora noticed how slim and frail Dick&rsquo;s form
looked and how sinewy and strong was Jerry.</p>
<p>The edge reached, the boys gazed down, but
almost instantly Jerry had whirled to an upright
position and the watching girls could not
tell whether his expression was more of terror
than of exultation. Surely there was a mingling of both.</p>
<p>Dick, who had backed several feet before sitting
upright, was frankly shocked by what he
had seen.</p>
<p>For a moment neither of them spoke.
&ldquo;Boys!&rdquo; Dora cried. &ldquo;The stage coach is down
there, isn&rsquo;t it? But since you expected to find
it, <i>why</i> are you so startled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry was the first to reply. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s
pretty awful to see what&rsquo;s left of a tragedy
like that. I reckon you girls would better not
look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, if you don&rsquo;t want me to,&rdquo; Mary
agreed, &ldquo;but <i>do</i> tell us about it. After all these
years, what <i>can</i> there be left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry glanced at Dick, who, always pale, was
actually white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll confess it rather got me, just at first,&rdquo;
the Eastern boy acknowledged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>Dora, impatient at the slowness of the revelation,
and eager to see for herself what shocking
thing was over the ledge, started to walk toward
the edge, but Dick, realizing her intention,
sprang up and caught her arm. &ldquo;Let us tell
you first what we saw, Dora,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;and
then, if you still want to see it, we won&rsquo;t prevent
you. It won&rsquo;t be so much of a shock when
you are prepared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Dora stood waiting.</p>
<p>The boys were on their feet. Jerry began.
&ldquo;When the horses reared and plunged off the
road, they must have rolled with the stage over
and over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Dick excitedly took up the
tale, &ldquo;and when the coach struck this wide
ledge, it bounded, I should say, off into space
and was caught in a wide crevice about twenty-five
feet straight down below here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jerry,&rdquo; Mary cried, &ldquo;is the driver or
the horses&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cowboy nodded vehemently. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just
it. That&rsquo;s the terribly gruesome part. The
skeletons of the horses are hanging in the harness
and that poor driver&mdash;his skeleton, I mean,
still sits in his seat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The uncanny thing about it,&rdquo; Dick rushed
in, &ldquo;is that his leather suit is still on his skeleton,
and his fur cap, though bedraggled from
the weather, is still on his bony head.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But his eyes are the worst!&rdquo; Jerry shuddered,
although seeing skeletons was no new
thing to him. &ldquo;Those gaping sockets are looking
right up toward this ledge as though he had
died gazing up toward the road hoping help
would come to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Mary threw her arms about Dora
and began to sob. Jerry, again self-rebuking,
cried in alarm, &ldquo;Oh, Little Sister, I reckon I&rsquo;m
a brute to shock you that-a-way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora had noticed that in times of excitement
Jerry fell into the lingo of the cowboy.</p>
<p>Mary straightened and smiled through her
tears. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry for that poor man,
but I must remember that it all happened years
ago and that <i>now</i> we are really bent on a mission
of charity.&rdquo; Then, smiling up at Jerry,
she held out a hand to him as she said, &ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s</i>
the big thing for us to remember, isn&rsquo;t it? First
of all, we want, if possible, to find out if poor
Little Bodil is alive and if we&rsquo;re sure, oh, just
<i>ever</i> so sure, that she is dead, we want to get
the gold and turquoise from Mr. Pedersen&rsquo;s
rock house for the Dooleys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her listeners were sure that Mary was talking
about their good purpose that she might
quiet her nerves. It evidently had the desired
effect, for, quite naturally, she asked, &ldquo;If there
is nothing beneath this ledge but space, how
can you boys get down to the stage coach to
search for clues? That&rsquo;s what you planned
doing, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>Jerry nodded and gazed thoughtfully into the
sweet face uplifted to his, though hardly seeing
it. He was thinking what would be best
for them to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;you stay here with
the girls. I&rsquo;m going back up to the car to get
my rope. I reckon if you three will hold one
end of it, I can slide down on it to that crevice
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no, Jerry, don&rsquo;t, <i>please don&rsquo;t</i>!&rdquo;
Mary caught his khaki-covered arm wildly.
&ldquo;You would never get over the shock of being
so close to that ghastly skeleton and if the rope
should slip&mdash;&rdquo; she covered her eyes with her
hands. Then, as she heard the boys speaking
together in low tones, she looked at them.
&ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; she said contritely, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I go
to pieces so easily today. Of course I know
you would not suggest going if you weren&rsquo;t
sure that it would be absolutely safe. Get the
rope if you want to. I&rsquo;m going to try hard to
be as brave as Dora is.&rdquo; Then she added wistfully,
&ldquo;Maybe if you weren&rsquo;t my Big Brother,
I wouldn&rsquo;t care so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sudden joy leaped to Jerry&rsquo;s eyes. How he
had hoped that Mary cared a little, oh, even a
<i>very</i> little, for him, but usually she treated him
in the same frank, friendly way that she did
Dick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>Dora, watching, thought, &ldquo;That settles it.
Jerry will not go. The Dooleys and Little Bodil
are nothing to him compared to one second&rsquo;s
anxiety for his Sister Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it did seem for a long moment that Jerry
was going to give up the entire plan. Dick, realizing
this, plunged in with, &ldquo;I say, old man, I
know how to go down a rope. That used to be
one of my favorite pastimes when I was a
youngster and lived near a fire station. The
good-natured firemen would let us kids slide
down their slippery pole but we had to do some
tall scurrying when the alarm sounded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry looked at his friend for several
thoughtful seconds before he spoke. What he
said was, &ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;re right, Dick, but my
reason is this. I&rsquo;m strong-armed and you&rsquo;re
not. Throwing the rope and pulling cantankerous
steers around, gives a fellow an iron muscle.
And you&rsquo;re lighter too, a lot, so I reckon
I&rsquo;d better be on the end that has to be held.
Now that&rsquo;s settled, you stay here with the girls
while I go up to the car and get my rope.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br />A NARROW ESCAPE</h2>
<p>The long rope with which Jerry had captured
many a wild cow was dropped over the
outer edge of the wide ledge. Since the distance
was not more than twenty-five feet, the
lariat reached nearly to the crevice. Looking
around, Jerry found a projecting rock about
which he wound the upper end of the rope, but
he did not trust it alone. He threw himself face
downward and grasped the knot that was nearest
the edge in a firm clasp. He told the girls
he would not need their assistance at first, but
that, if he shouted, they were to both seize the
rope near the rock and pull with all their
strength.</p>
<p>Dick, making light of the feat he was about
to perform, tossed his sombrero to one side,
and then, with his hand on his heart, he made
a gallant bow to the girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>Dora and Mary, standing close to the rock
around which the rope was twined, clung to
each other nervously. They tried to smile encouragingly
toward the pretending acrobat, but
they were too anxious to put much brightness
into the effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kick off your boots,&rdquo; Jerry said in a low
voice; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be able to cling to the knots
better in stocking feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sort of an anti-climax.&rdquo; Dick&rsquo;s large brown
eyes laughed through the shell-rimmed glasses
as he removed his boots. &ldquo;There, <i>now</i> I do the
renowned disappearing act. I&rsquo;d feel more
heroic if I were about to rescue someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick isn&rsquo;t the least bit afraid, is he, Jerry?&rdquo;
Mary asked in a whispered voice as though she
did not want the boy who had gone over the
ledge to be conscious of the fear that she felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Jerry reported a second
later. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going down the rope as nimbly as
a monkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will there be room on the edge of that
crevice for him to stand when he <i>does</i> get
down?&rdquo; was Mary&rsquo;s next question.</p>
<p>There was a long moment&rsquo;s silence, then
Jerry turned his head and smiled reassuringly.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s down! Oh, yes, there&rsquo;s ten feet or more
for him to walk on. He&rsquo;s got hold of the front
wheel of the old coach.&rdquo; The cowboy&rsquo;s voice
changed to a warning shout, &ldquo;I say, Dick, down
there! <i>Don&rsquo;t try</i> to get aboard! The whole
thing might crumble and take you to the bottom
of that pit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>The girls could hear a faint shout from
below. Dick evidently had assured Jerry that
he would be cautious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could come over where you are,
Jerry,&rdquo; Dora said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to watch Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay where you are, please.&rdquo; The order,
without the last word, would have sounded
abrupt. &ldquo;Er&mdash;I may need your help with the
rope. Keep alert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be alerter if I tried,&rdquo; Mary said
in a low voice to her companion. &ldquo;Every nerve
in my whole body is so tense I&rsquo;m afraid something
will snap or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Jumping Jehoshaphat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s startled ejaculation and sudden leap
to his knees caused the girls to cry in alarm,
&ldquo;Did Dick fall? Oh! Oh! What has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry turned toward them and shook his
head. &ldquo;Sorry I hollered out that way. Nothing
happened that matters any.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But something did, and if you don&rsquo;t tell us,
we&rsquo;ll come over there and see for ourselves.&rdquo;
Dora&rsquo;s tone was so determined that Jerry said,
&ldquo;Sure I&rsquo;ll tell you. When Dick took hold of
the front wheel of the stage, he must have
jarred the seat, for, all at once, the driver&rsquo;s
skeleton collapsed and toppled off and down
into that deep crevice. Well, that&rsquo;ll be more
comfortable for an eternal resting place, I
reckon, than sitting upright was, the way he&rsquo;s
been doing this forty years past.&rdquo; Then he
called, &ldquo;Hey, down there, <i>what</i> did you say? I
didn&rsquo;t hear. Your voice is blown off toward the
Little Grand Canyon, I reckon.&rdquo; Jerry sat intently
listening, one big brown hand cupped
about his right ear. The girls could hear Dick&rsquo;s
voice coming faintly from below. Jerry showed
signs of excited interest. The girls exchanged
wondering glances but did not speak until the
cowboy turned toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick says there&rsquo;s a small, child-size trunk
under the driver&rsquo;s seat. Whizzle! I wish I were
down there. Together we might be able to get
it out.&rdquo; Leaping to his feet, Jerry went to the
rock around which the rope was tied. &ldquo;<i>That</i>
ought to hold all right!&rdquo; There was a glint of
determination in his gray eyes, but it wavered
as he glanced at Mary who stood watching him,
but saying not a word. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t anything
<i>here</i> to frighten you girls, is there?&rdquo; He seemed
to be imploring the smaller girl to tell him to
go. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this-a-way. If there is a child-size
box or trunk in the stage coach still, it was
probably Little Bodil&rsquo;s, and don&rsquo;t you see,
Mary, how <i>important</i> it is for us to get it. Why,
I reckon a clue would be there all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary held out a small white hand. &ldquo;Go along,
Big Brother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re sure the
rock will hold the rope with your weight on
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we help the rock by holding onto the
rope as well?&rdquo; It was practical Dora who asked
that question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Jerry&rsquo;s expression brightened. &ldquo;I
wish you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora thought, &ldquo;Mr. Cowboy, I know <i>just</i>
what <i>you</i> are thinking. You&rsquo;re afraid we <i>might</i>
go over to the edge and perhaps fall off, but
that if you tell us to hold onto the rope here by
the rock, you expect we&rsquo;ll stay put, but you&rsquo;re
mistaken. As soon as I know you&rsquo;re safely
down, I&rsquo;m going to crawl over the ledge and
peer down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Dora was thus planning, she and Mary
held to the highest knot in the rope, and Jerry,
having removed his boots, went over the edge
without the grand flourish that Dick had made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t, <i>can&rsquo;t</i> hold it!&rdquo; Mary exclaimed,
and then Dora realized that the younger girl
had been trying to hold Jerry&rsquo;s weight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she ejaculated. &ldquo;The rock can hold
him. Just keep your hands lightly on the knot
and pull <i>only</i> if the rope starts slipping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed but a few moments before the girls
heard, as from far below, a reassuring call,
&ldquo;All&rsquo;s well!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>At once Dora let go her hold on the rope
and dropped face downward as the boys had
done. Mary was not to be left behind. Cautiously,
they wormed their way to the edge of
the cliff and peered over, being careful to keep
hidden. Only their hair and eyes were over the
edge, and the boys, intent on examining the
skeleton stage coach, did not once glance up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-oo!&rdquo; Mary shuddered. &ldquo;That black
crevice looks as though it went down into the
mountain a mile or more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it does!&rdquo; Dora whispered. &ldquo;Jerry
said that it&rsquo;s more than a mile from here to the
floor of the desert. The crack in the mountain
may go all the way down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I <i>do</i> wish the boys wouldn&rsquo;t go so close
to the edge of it!&rdquo; Mary whispered frantically.
&ldquo;Dora Bellman, if Dick or Jerry slipped into
that awful place&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora&rsquo;s interrupting voice was impatient.
&ldquo;<i>Please</i> don&rsquo;t start <i>imagining</i> terrible things.
Those boys value their own lives as much as
we possibly can. Look! See how very cautiously
they&rsquo;re taking hold of the driver&rsquo;s seat and
testing its strength. Blue Moons!&rdquo; It was
Dora&rsquo;s turn to be horrified. &ldquo;Jerry is lifting
Dick. My, aren&rsquo;t his arms powerful? Now Dick
is resting his left hand on the top of the seat
and pulling on that box with his right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary clutched Dora&rsquo;s arms, but neither spoke
a word as they watched the movements of the
boys with startled, staring eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming slowly.&rdquo; Dora&rsquo;s voice was
tense. &ldquo;Hark! Didn&rsquo;t you hear a creak as
though something about the stage had snapped
suddenly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks be!&rdquo; The words were a shout of
relief. &ldquo;The box is out, but oh, Mary! <i>Not a
second</i> too soon! The skeleton stage coach is
collapsing! It has dropped right down out of
sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls sat up with one accord and
stared at each other, their faces white.</p>
<p>Mary was the first to speak. Her tone was
reproachful. &ldquo;And yet <i>you</i> were <i>so</i> sure the
boys would do nothing to endanger their lives.
If that crash had happened one minute sooner,
they would both have gone down with it. Dick
couldn&rsquo;t have leaped back in time, and Jerry
would have lost his balance, and you needn&rsquo;t
tell me I&rsquo;m using my imagination, either, for
you <i>know</i> it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no denying that the boys had had
a most narrow escape and Dora willingly
acknowledged that they had taken a greater
risk than she had supposed they would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As though finding that lost Bodil, or even
getting money to help the Dooleys, was worth
endangering <i>their</i> lives,&rdquo; Mary continued with
such a show of indignation that Dora actually
laughed. &ldquo;Since it&rsquo;s all over, let&rsquo;s forget it.
I&rsquo;m terribly thrilled about the box. I feel just
as sure as the boys do that there will be something
in it that will be a clue, or at least, lead
to one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; Mary said. &ldquo;The boys are calling
to us. See, the rope is swaying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lying flat again, Dora peered over and called,
&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry replied, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re tying the box to the
rope. Can you two girls pull it up? Don&rsquo;t
stand near the edge to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Dick called. Then he said something
to Jerry that the girls couldn&rsquo;t hear. Dora saw
the cowboy laugh and pound on his head. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
calling himself a dumb-bell, looks like,&rdquo; she
whispered to Mary. Then Jerry&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
take back that order. You stand by the rock,
will you, and grab the rope if it starts to slip.
Dick will climb up and help lift the box. He&rsquo;s
such a light weight, he and the box together
won&rsquo;t be any heavier than I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls went back to the rock and saw that
the rope held. They knelt by it in readiness to
seize it if it slipped. They could tell by the
tightening of the rope that Dick was ascending.
In another moment, he sprang over the edge,
pulled up the box without asking the girls for
assistance, then dropped the rope down again.
Soon they were joined by a beaming Jerry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII
<br />A SAND STORM</h2>
<p>The return to the car was not without difficulties.
At the spot where the natural steps
were not close together, Jerry, finding the
merest toe-hold in the cliff and only the scraggliest
growth to which he could cling, did, however,
manage to reach the step above. He then
dropped one end of the rope down and Dick
ascended nimbly. Then, Jerry made a swing of
the lariat. Mary, flushed and laughing up at
him, sat in it and was slowly lifted to the ledge
above. This, being narrow, could hold no more
than three. So Mary climbed still higher, then
turned and watched, while Dora was lifted in
the swing. The girls were told to return to the
car while the boys tied the box on the end of
the rope and drew it up over the sheer place.</p>
<p>From the road, Mary looked out far across
the desert. &ldquo;How queer the air looks, doesn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; she said, pointing to what seemed to be a
huge yellow cloud of sand which was moving
rapidly across the floor of the desert and shutting
out the Little Grand Canyon from their
view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>Jerry, with the small trunk on one shoulder
joined them; Dick, whirling the lariat playfully,
was not far behind.</p>
<p>Mary again pointed. &ldquo;What is that far below
there, Jerry? Is it a wind storm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon that&rsquo;s what it is,&rdquo; Jerry said.
&ldquo;Carrying enough sand with it to change
things up a little. But more&rsquo;n like, it will blow
itself away before we get down to the valley
road.&rdquo; He seemed little concerned about it and
the girls, in their curiosity about the small
trunk, also forgot it. Where they stood, in a
flood of late warm afternoon sun, there was not
a breath of air stirring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a queer little trunk,&rdquo; Mary said,
touching the battered top of it with an investigating
finger. &ldquo;What is it made of, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me guessing,&rdquo; the cowboy replied.
&ldquo;Some kind of a thick animal skin, I
reckon, stretched over a frame. It tightened as
it dried. Shouldn&rsquo;t you say so, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy addressed was helping to lash the
small box on the running board of the car. &ldquo;It
looks like a home-made affair to me,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Probably they brought it over from Scandinavia.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>Dora was peering around it. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a
lock,&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;I suppose whatever it
was tied with rotted away long ago.&rdquo; Then, as
another thought came, &ldquo;Oh, Jerry, if we had
waited, maybe even a week, the stage coach
might have crumbled, don&rsquo;t you think? It
couldn&rsquo;t have stayed together much longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto!&rdquo; the cowboy continued. Then, with
a quick glance at Dick, he said, &ldquo;Now that it&rsquo;s
over, I&rsquo;m thankful it has gone,&mdash;the stage
coach, I mean. Dick and I might have been
tempted to come back and look for more clues,
and believe me, we came within <i>one</i> of going to
the bottom, but Jumping Steers! we didn&rsquo;t, and
it sure was some exciting adventure, wasn&rsquo;t it,
old man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Dick could reply, Mary said emphatically,
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have <i>let</i> you come back
again, Jerry. You call me &lsquo;Little Sister,&rsquo; and
brothers <i>always</i> have to <i>obey</i>, don&rsquo;t they,
Dora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her friend laughingly denied, &ldquo;Not <i>my</i>
small brother, believe me, <span class="sc">NO</span>. When I want him
to do a thing, I ask the opposite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry had seemed to be too intent on tying
knots securely to have heard, but when he
turned, his gray eyes smiled at the smaller
girl, adoring her. &ldquo;<i>This</i> Big Brother is the
exception which proves the rule,&rdquo; he quoted.
&ldquo;Command, Little Sister, and I will obey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; Dora teased. Then, to the other
girl, &ldquo;Please command that we start for home.
I&rsquo;m wild to get there so that we may look
through the trunk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>Jerry removed the rocks that held the wheels.
Dick was glancing about the part of the road
where the small car stood. &ldquo;Do you plan turning
here, Jerry?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I was wondering,
because I heard you say it would be miles out
of our way, if we kept going straight on over
the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before answering, Jerry stood, looking, not
at the road, but down at the valley sand storm
which had not decreased in density. In fact it
had widened and was hiding the lower part of
the mountain on which they stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much gas have we, Dick?&rdquo; Jerry
asked, making no comment on the sand storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About four gallons. And another five in the
storage can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Again Jerry&rsquo;s gray eyes looked
thoughtfully about. They seemed to be measuring
the width of the road between the peak at
their right and the edge of the descent at the
left. Dick stepped back and through narrowed
lids, he also estimated the distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A leetle more than twice the width of the
car,&rdquo; he guessed. &ldquo;Say, old man,&rdquo; Dick
stepped eagerly toward the cowboy, &ldquo;let <i>me</i>
turn it, will you? Back East, one of the crazy
things we did at school was to have contests on
car turning. I was pretty durn good at it then.
Could turn around on a dime, so to speak.&rdquo;
Still Jerry hesitated. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know
<i>this</i> car&mdash;&rdquo; he began, when Dick interrupted
swaggeringly, to try to make the girls think the
feat would be less serious than it really would
be. &ldquo;Why, my dear <i>vaquero</i>, a wild car is as
docile with me as a wild broncho would be with
you&mdash;knows the master&rsquo;s touch and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as Jerry still hesitated, Dick leaped up
under the wheel and called to the girls: &ldquo;Stand
back, if you please, and make room for the
world famous&mdash;&rdquo; the engine was starting, the
car slowly turning. Dick did not finish his
joking speech. He directed all his thought and
skill to the turning of the car. There was a
tense silence broken by Dora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there was lots of room after all!&rdquo; she
cried admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whizzle!&rdquo; Jerry had expected Dick to
give up. &ldquo;I reckon you didn&rsquo;t rate yourself
any too high when you were boasting about
your skill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He helped Mary up to her seat, then took
the place Dick had relinquished to climb in back
with Dora. Slowly the small car started down
the road which they had ascended hours before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What thrilling adventures and narrow
escapes we have had today!&rdquo; Dora exclaimed,
loud enough for Jerry to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon they&rsquo;re not all over yet,&rdquo; the cowboy
replied,&mdash;then wished he had not spoken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose Jerry means?&rdquo; Dora
asked in a low voice of Dick.</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s first reply was a shrug of his
shoulders. &ldquo;Nothing, really; at least I don&rsquo;t
think he does.&rdquo; Then, as they rounded an outflung
curve in the road and he saw the dull
yellow flying cloud far below them, Dick added,
as though suddenly understanding, &ldquo;Oho, I
savvy. Jerry is thinking of the sand storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, of course, it <i>can&rsquo;t</i> climb the mountain
and equally, of course, Jerry won&rsquo;t run right
out into it,&rdquo; Dora said. Dick agreed, then
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>what</i> if the sand storm lasted for hours
and we had to stay in the mountain all night,
wouldn&rsquo;t that be another adventure, and if we
should hear pumas prowling around the car
wishing to devour us, wouldn&rsquo;t that be a narrow
escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora laughed. &ldquo;Do you know, Dick, when I
first met you, I thought you were as solemn as
an owl. I didn&rsquo;t dream that you were, I mean,
<i>are</i> a humorist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for not saying clown.&rdquo; Dick seemed
so ridiculously grateful that Dora laughed
again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You remind me of Harold Lloyd,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and I hope you think that&rsquo;s a compliment. He
looks through his shell-rimmed glasses just as
solemnly as you do when he&rsquo;s saying the
funniest things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of replying, Dick peered curiously
ahead. &ldquo;I reckon the &lsquo;another adventure or
narrow escape&rsquo; is about to happen,&rdquo; he said in
a low voice close to Dora&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Leastwise our
vehicle is slowing to a stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry, making sure that the front wheels
were safely wedged against the mountain,
turned and inquired, &ldquo;Dick, can you and Dora
hear a roaring noise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that the car has stopped rattling, I
can,&rdquo; Dick replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the sand storm, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Dora leaned
forward to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Jerry glanced back, troubled. &ldquo;There
are two valley roads forking off just below
here. One goes over toward the Chiricahua
Mountains where our ranch is, the other toward
Gleeson where we have to go to take the girls.
Now what I want to say is this. Our road is
clear, but the Gleeson road is in the path of the
sand storm. Of course, if the wind should
change, it might catch us, but I reckon our best
chance is to race across the open valley to
<i>Bar N</i> ranch. You girls would have to stay all
night, but Mother&rsquo;d like that powerful well. We
could telephone to Gleeson so your dad
wouldn&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>Mary, who had been listening with anxious
eyes, now put in, &ldquo;But, Jerry, wouldn&rsquo;t that
sand storm cut down the wires? I&rsquo;d hate to
have Dad anxious if there was any possible
way of getting home&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; Dick announced. &ldquo;If, after we
reach the ranch, we find we can&rsquo;t communicate
with your home, Jerry and I will ride over
there on horseback. The sand storm will surely
be blown away by then.&rdquo; His questioning glance
turned toward Jerry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; the cowboy replied. &ldquo;Now,
girls, hold tight! We&rsquo;re going to drop down to
the cross valley road. It&rsquo;s smooth and hard
and we&rsquo;re going to beat the world&rsquo;s record.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br />&ldquo;A.&rsquo;S AND N. E.&rsquo;S.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The girls held tight as they had been commanded,
their nerves taut and tense. Jerry&rsquo;s
prophecy that they might yet have another
thrilling adventure and narrow escape filled
them with a sort of startled expectancy. They
could not see the forking valley roads until
they had dropped down the last steep descent
of the mountain and were almost upon them.
Jerry unconsciously uttered an exclamation of
relief. The road that went straight as a taut
lariat across miles of flat, sandy waste was
glistening in the late afternoon sun. The distant
Chiricahua range, at the foot of which
nestled the Newcomb ranch, was hung with a
misty lilac haze. Peace seemed to pervade the
scene and yet they could all four distinctly hear
a dull ominous roar.</p>
<p>Before starting to &ldquo;beat the world&rsquo;s record,&rdquo;
Jerry stopped the car and listened. His desert-trained
ear could surely discern the direction
of the roaring sound. They were still too close
to the mountain to see the desert on their right
or left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>Turning to Dick, he asked, &ldquo;Is there any
water left in the canteen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the other boy replied, sensing the
seriousness of the request, &ldquo;about a gallon, I
should say. It&rsquo;s right here at our feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Have the top loose so that you can
drench our handkerchiefs at a split second&rsquo;s
notice. Have them ready, girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jerry,&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s expression was one
of excited animation, &ldquo;do you expect the sand
storm to overtake us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I really don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The cowboy was starting
the engine again. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s always wise to
take precautions.&rdquo; Then, addressing the small
car, &ldquo;Now, little old &lsquo;tin Cayuse,&rsquo; show your
stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The start was so sudden and so violent that
Dora was thrown forward. Dick drew her back
and they smiled at each other glowingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is a jolly lark today, isn&rsquo;t it, so full of
a.&rsquo;s and n. e.&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you mean adventures and narrow
escapes.&rdquo; Dora straightened her small hat
that had been twisted awry. Then, as they sped
away from the shelter of the grim, gray towering
mountain, they all four looked quickly to
the right and left. The desert lay dreaming in
the sun. To the far south of them the air was
full of a sinister yellow wall of flying sand and
dust. It was surely headed in the opposite
direction. Jerry did not doubt it and since he
did not, the girls and Dick had no sense of fear.
The ominous roaring sound had lessened, although,
of course, they could hear little when
that small car was speeding, its own squeaks
and rattles having been increased.</p>
<p>Mary turned a face flushed with excitement
and called back to Dora, &ldquo;Ten miles! Only ten
more to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a perfect road, recently completed.
There was almost no sand on it and very few
dips.</p>
<p>Dick waved up toward a low circling vulture.
&ldquo;That fellow&rsquo;s eyes are popping out in
amazement, more than likely,&rdquo; he shouted to
Dora.</p>
<p>She laughed back, holding tight to her hat.
&ldquo;He probably thinks this is some new kind of
a stampede.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Mary&rsquo;s pretty glowing face appeared
in the opening back of the front seat. &ldquo;Fifteen
miles! Only five more to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s expression became anxious. He said,
close to Dora&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;If Jerry feels so sure that
the sand storm is headed toward Mexico, I
don&rsquo;t think he ought to race this little machine.
He may know a lot more than I do about busting
bronchos, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>An explosion interrupted Dick&rsquo;s remark, then
the car zigzagged wildly from side to side.
Jerry turned off the spark and the gas. Dick,
without thought, leaped out onto the running
board and put his weight over the wheel with
the blow-out in its tire.</p>
<p>Almost miraculously the car stayed in the
road. The girls had been wonderful. White
and terrorized, yet neither had clutched at her
companion, nor hindered his doing what was
best for their safety.</p>
<p>When the car stopped, the front right tire
was almost off the road. The girls, quivering
with excitement, got out and exclaimed simultaneously,
&ldquo;Another adventure and narrow escape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick, knowing better than the girls how truly
narrow their escape had been, stepped forward,
his dark eyes serious, and extended a hand to
the cowboy. &ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t say again that I probably know more
about managing cars than you do. If it hadn&rsquo;t
been for your quick thinking and skill, we
would surely have turned turtle in the sand and
if the spark had been on, the car might have
gone up in flames.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>But Jerry would not accept the compliment.
He shook his head as he removed his sombrero
and wiped beads of moisture from his forehead.
&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;thanks just the same, but I
reckon I was needlessly reckless. I wasn&rsquo;t right
sure about the sand storm, just at first, but
later when I saw that it was heading south all
right, I kept on speeding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to the smaller girl who stood very
still; seemingly calm, though her lips quivered
when she tried to smile, the cowboy said contritely,
&ldquo;Little Sister, if you won&rsquo;t stop trusting me,
I&rsquo;ll swear to never again take any such
needless risks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora, watching the two, thought, &ldquo;It matters
such a terrible lot to Jerry what Mary thinks
about him. Some day she&rsquo;s going to wake up
and realize that he loves her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was removing his coat, and Jerry, evidently
satisfied with Mary&rsquo;s low-spoken reply,
turned to get tools out from under the front
seat.</p>
<p>Half an hour later the small car was again
on its way. The sun was setting behind the
mountains where so recently they had been.</p>
<p>Mary looked back at them. Grim and dark
and forbidding they were, deep in shadow, but
the peaks were aglow with flame color. The
floor of the desert valley about them was like
a sea of shimmering golden water; the ripples
and dunes of sand were like glistening waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a gloriousness!&rdquo; Dora exclaimed,
turning a radiant face toward her companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can see the color of it in your eyes,&rdquo; the
boy told her, and a sudden admiration in his
own dark eyes caused Dora to think that Dick
was really seeing her for the first time.</p>
<p>It was lilac dusk when the small car drove
along the lane of cottonwood trees and stopped
at one side of the <i>Bar N</i> ranch house.</p>
<p>Mrs. Newcomb&rsquo;s round pleasant face looked
out of a kitchen window, then her apron-covered
person appeared in the open side door.
Her arms were held out to welcome Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, my dear,&rdquo; she said tenderly, &ldquo;how
glad I am that you blew over to <i>Bar N</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We almost literally <i>did</i> blow over,&rdquo; Mary
laughingly replied. &ldquo;That is, we were running
away from a sand storm.&rdquo; Then, suddenly
serious, she asked, &ldquo;Oh, Aunt Molly, may I use
your telephone at once? Dad doesn&rsquo;t know that
I&rsquo;m here and he will be expecting us back for
supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, dear. You know where it is, in
the living-room.&rdquo; Then, when Mary had
skipped away, Dora following her, Mrs. Newcomb
asked, &ldquo;Has there been a sand storm in
the valley? I hadn&rsquo;t heard about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry was about to drive the small car
around to the old barn and so Dick replied,
&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Newcomb. That&rsquo;s what Jerry called
it. We first saw it on the other side of the
range back of Gleeson. Later we saw it far
away to the south. It didn&rsquo;t cross this part of
the valley at all, but Jerry thought we&rsquo;d better
not try the Gleeson road.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He was wise. I hope the wires aren&rsquo;t
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good woman&rsquo;s anxiety was quickly ended
by the reappearance of the girls. &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well!&rdquo;
Mary announced. Then to Dick, &ldquo;Your mother
answered the phone. She said that they had
heard the roaring and had seen some dust in
the air but that the storm had passed around
our tableland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you girls had quite an adventure and
perhaps a narrow escape as well.&rdquo; Little did
Mrs. Newcomb realize that she was repeating
the phrase they had so often used that day.
&ldquo;Now, Mary, you take your friend to the spare
room and get ready for supper. Your Uncle
Henry will be in from riding the range pronto,
and starved as a lean wolf, no doubt. He&rsquo;s been
gone since sun-up and he won&rsquo;t take along
what he ought for his mid-lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were about to leave the kitchen
when Jerry called to Dick and away he went
into the gathering darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys sleep in the bunk house out by the
corral,&rdquo; Mrs. Newcomb explained. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be
back, I reckon, soon as you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>The spare room was large, square, with a
small fireplace in it. The bed was an old-fashioned
four-poster and looked luxuriously
comfortable.</p>
<p>A table, a dresser, two chairs of dark wood
and a bright rag rug completed the furnishings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How quiet it is,&rdquo; Mary said. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t
a neighbor nearer than those Dooleys and Jerry
said they are way over in the canyon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora, wondering if Mary could be contented
if she became Jerry&rsquo;s wife, some day in the
future, asked, &ldquo;Would <i>you</i> like to live on a
ranch, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Innocently, Mary replied as she lighted the
kerosene lamp on the bureau, &ldquo;Why, yes, I&rsquo;m
sure I would, if Dad could be with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora sighed as she thought, &ldquo;Poor Jerry.
She&rsquo;s still blind and I <i>did</i> think today that her
eyes were opened.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br />IN THE BARN LOFT</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry, what did you do with the box?&rdquo;
Mary managed to whisper as the cowboy drew
out a chair for her at the supper table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the old barn loft, snug and safe,&rdquo; he replied.
Then he sat beside her. Dora and Dick,
on the opposite side of the long table, beamed
across, eager anticipation in their eyes. Although
they had not heard the few words their
friends had spoken, they felt sure that they had
been about Little Bodil&rsquo;s box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t wait for your father, Jerry,&rdquo;
Mrs. Newcomb had said. &ldquo;He may have gone
in somewhere for shelter if he happened to be
riding in the path of the storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kerosene lamp hanging above the middle
of the table had a cherry-colored shade and cast
a cheerful glow over the simple meal of
warmed-over chicken, baked potatoes, corn
bread, sage honey and creamy milk, big
pitchers of it, one at each end of the table. For
dessert there was apple sauce and chocolate
layer cake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>Mr. Newcomb came in before they were
through, tall, sinewy, his kind brown face
deeply furrowed by wind and sun. His eyes
brightened with real pleasure when he saw the
guests. Dora, he had met before, and Mary he
had known since she was a little girl.</p>
<p>He shook hands with both of them. &ldquo;Wall,
wall, if that sand storm sent you girls this-a-way,
I figger it did some good after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry glanced at his father anxiously when
he was seated at the end of the table opposite
his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, do you reckon any of our cattle were
hit by it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The older man helped himself to the food
Mary passed him, before he replied, &ldquo;No-o, I
reckon not. I was riding the high pasture when
I heerd the roaring. I went out on Lookout
Point and stood there watching, till the dust
got so thick I had to make for the canyon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Dick who spoke. &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t many
cows pastured down on the floor of the valley,
anyway, are there, Mr. Newcomb? There&rsquo;s so
much sand and only an occasional clump of
grass, it surely isn&rsquo;t good pasture.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; the cowman agreed, &ldquo;but
there&rsquo;s a few poor men struggling along, tryin&rsquo;
to eke out an existence down thar. I reckon
they was hit hard. I knew a man, once, who had
a well and was tryin&rsquo; to raise a garden. One of
them sand storms swooped over it, and, after
it was gone, he couldn&rsquo;t find nary a vegetable.
Either they&rsquo;d been pulled up by the roots and
blown away or else they was buried so deep, he
couldn&rsquo;t dig down to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Uncle Henry,&rdquo; Mary smiled toward him
brightly, &ldquo;I see a twinkle in your eye. Now
confess, isn&rsquo;t that a sand-story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s true enough,&rdquo; the cowman replied,
when Jerry exclaimed: &ldquo;Dad, I know a bigger
one than that. You remember that man from
the East, tenderfoot if ever there was one, who
started to build him a house on the Neal crossroad?
He heard the storm coming so he jumped
on his horse and rode into Neal as though
demons were after him. When the wind stopped
blowing, he went back to look for his house and
there, where it had been, stood the beginning
of a sand hill. The adobe walls of his unfinished
house had caught so much sand, they
were completely covered. That was years ago.
Now there&rsquo;s a good-sized sand hill on that very
spot with yucca growing on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor man, it was the burial of his dreams,&rdquo;
Dora said sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He left for the East the next day,&rdquo; Jerry
finished his tale, &ldquo;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lived happily ever after, I hope,&rdquo; Mary
put in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>Mrs. Newcomb said pleasantly, &ldquo;If you
young people have finished your meal, don&rsquo;t
wait for us. Jerry told me you&rsquo;re going out to
the loft in the old barn for a secret meeting
about something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to help you, Aunt Mollie, if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No &lsquo;ifs&rsquo; to it, Mary dear.&rdquo; The older woman
gazed lovingly at the girl. &ldquo;Your Uncle Henry
and I visit quite a long spell evenings over
our tea. It&rsquo;s the only leisure time that we have
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry lighted a couple of lanterns, and the
girls, after having gone to their room for their
sweater coats, joined the boys on the wide,
back, screened-in porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go ahead,&rdquo; Jerry said, &ldquo;and Dick will
bring up the rear. We&rsquo;ll be the lantern bearers.
Now, don&rsquo;t you girls leave the path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why all the precautions?&rdquo; Dora asked
gaily, but Mary knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rattlesnakes may be abroad.&rdquo; She shuddered.
&ldquo;Have you seen one yet this summer,
Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this morning, and a mighty ugly one
too; coiled up asleep in the chicken yard. I
shot it, all right, but didn&rsquo;t kill it. Before I
could fire again, it had crawled under the old
barn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-oo gracious! That&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re going,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Dora peered into the darkness on
either side of the path.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it had a mate equally big and
ugly under the barn?&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s statement was
also a question.</p>
<p>Dick replied, &ldquo;Undoubtedly, but if they stay
<i>under</i> the barn and don&rsquo;t try to climb up to the
loft, they won&rsquo;t trouble us any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary, glancing up at the sky that was like
soft, dark blue velvet studded with luminous
stars, exclaimed, &ldquo;How wonderfully clear the
air is, and how still. You never would dream
that a sand storm had&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped suddenly, for Dora had gripped
her arm from the back. &ldquo;Listen! Didn&rsquo;t you
hear a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gun shot?&rdquo; Dick supplied gaily. &ldquo;Now
that we&rsquo;re about to open up Little Bodil&rsquo;s box,
I certainly expect to hear one. You know we
heard a gun fired, or thought we did, when we
passed through the gate in front of Lucky
Loon&rsquo;s rock house, and again when old Silas
Harvey was telling us the story. Was that
what you thought you heard, Dora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was not,&rdquo; that maiden replied indignantly.
&ldquo;I thought I heard a rattle.&rdquo; She had
stopped still in the path to listen, but, as Jerry
and Mary had continued walking toward the
old barn, Dora decided that she had been mistaken
and skipped along to catch up. Dick,
sorry that he had teased her, evidently at an
inopportune time, ran after her with the lantern.
&ldquo;Please forgive me,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;and
don&rsquo;t rush along that way where the path is
dark.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>Jerry turned to call, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going in the
side door, Dick.&rdquo; Then anxiously, &ldquo;You girls
can climb a wall ladder, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we can,&rdquo; Dora replied spiritedly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re regular acrobats in our gym at school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having reached the barn, Dick opened a low
door, then holding the lantern high, that the
girls might see the step, he assisted them both
over the sill and followed closely.</p>
<p>Mary was standing in the small leather-scented
harness-room, looking about the old
wooden floor with an anxious expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wondering,&rdquo; she explained when the
light from a lantern flashed in her face, &ldquo;if
there are any holes in the floor large enough
for those rattlers to crawl through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I mentioned that ugly old fellow,&rdquo;
Jerry said contritely, &ldquo;and yet we do
have to be constantly on the watch, but we&rsquo;re
safe enough now. Here&rsquo;s the wall ladder and
the little loft storeroom is just above us. The
only hard part is at the top where one of the
cross bars is missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick suggested, &ldquo;We boys can go up first
and reach a hand down to the girls when they
come to that step.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Righto,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave my lantern
on the floor here. You take yours up, old man.
Then we&rsquo;ll have illumination in both places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls had worn their knickers under their
short skirts as they always did when they went
on a hike or a mountain climb and so they went
up the rough wall ladder as nimbly as the boys
had done. The last step was more difficult, but,
with the help of strong arms they soon stood on
the floor of the low loft room. All manner of
discarded tools, harness and boxes were piled
about the walls.</p>
<p>Dora was curious. &ldquo;Jerry, <i>why</i> did you
select this out-of-the-way place for Bodil&rsquo;s
trunk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I reckoned no one would disturb
us. The Dooley twins overrun the old barn
sometimes but they can&rsquo;t climb up here with
the top board missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The battered leather box lay in the middle
of the room and the two girls looking down
at it had a strangely uncanny feeling. Jerry
evidently had not, for he was about to lift the
lid when Mary caught his arm, exclaiming,
&ldquo;Big Brother, <i>what</i> was it Silas Harvey said
about a ghost? I mean, didn&rsquo;t Mr. Pedersen
threaten to haunt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The interruption was the crackling report
of a gun that was very close to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great heavens, <i>what</i> was that?&rdquo; Mary
screamed and clung to Jerry terrified.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a ghost who fired that shot,&rdquo; the
cowboy told them. &ldquo;It was someone just outside
the barn. Don&rsquo;t be frightened, girls. It
can&rsquo;t be anyone who wants to harm us. Wait,
I&rsquo;ll call out the window here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry pulled open a wooden blind and
shouted, &ldquo;<i>Who&rsquo;s</i> there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father&rsquo;s voice replied, &ldquo;Lucky I happened
along when I did. An ugly rattler was
wriggling, half dead from a wound, right along
the path here and its mate was coiled in a sage
bush watching it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora seized Dick&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;I heard it!&rdquo; she
cried excitedly. &ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s</i> what I heard when you
began to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, I say, Dora,&rdquo; Dick was truly remorseful,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly sorry. I just didn&rsquo;t want you
to be using your imagination and frightening
yourself needlessly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary sank down on a dusty old box. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
absolutely limp,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now, if a ghost
appears when we open that trunk, I&rsquo;ll simply
collapse.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><br />CHAPTER XVI
<br />SEARCHING FOR CLUES</h2>
<p>The four young people in the loft listened
as Mr. Newcomb closed the gate to the hen-yard,
then, when they heard him leaving, Jerry
said, &ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;re alone now, so let&rsquo;s get
ahead with the box opening ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Big Brother,&rdquo; Mary, quite recovered
from her recent fright, exclaimed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make
a <i>real ceremony</i> of it, shall we? Let&rsquo;s kneel
on the floor; you boys at the sides and we girls
at the ends. There now, let&rsquo;s all lift at once and
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Dora cried, detaining them. &ldquo;Just
to add to the suspense, let&rsquo;s each tell what we
expect to find in the box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary looked across at her friend vaguely.
&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. What do <i>you</i>
hope that we&rsquo;ll find, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon what we <i>want</i> to find is something
that will help us locate Little Bodil,&rdquo; the cowboy
replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; Dick put in wisely, &ldquo;since Little
Bodil was thrown from the stage coach forty
years ago, how can <i>anything</i> that was already
<i>in</i> her trunk prove to us whether she was devoured
by wild animals or carried away by
bandits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-oo!&rdquo; Mary shuddered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
<i>which</i> would be worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora was agreeing with Dick. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right
of course,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully, &ldquo;but, nevertheless
I&rsquo;ve a hunch that we&rsquo;ll find something
that will, in some roundabout way, prove to
us whether Little Bodil is dead or alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if <i>that&rsquo;s</i> settled, let the ceremony proceed,&rdquo;
Jerry announced. In the dim lantern
light Mary&rsquo;s fair face and Dora&rsquo;s olive-tinted
glowed with excited animation as they took hold
of the trunk ends.</p>
<p>The top, however, did not come off as readily
as they had anticipated. The many winter
storms and the burning summer heat to which
the box had been exposed had warped the
cover, binding it tight. Jerry, glancing about
the room, found a broken tool which he could
use as a wedge. With it he loosened the cover.
Then it was easily removed.</p>
<p>The first emotion was one of disappointment.
The small trunk contained little, nothing at all,
the young people decided, that could be considered
as a clue. There was a plaid woolen
dress for a child of about eight or ten and the
coarsest of home-made underwear, knit stockings
and a small pair of carpet slippers with
patched soles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>A hand-carved wooden doll, in a plaid dress,
which evidently had been made by the child,
had been lovingly wrapped in a small red
shawl. Lastly, tied up in a quilted blue bonnet
with the strings, was a carved wooden bowl
and spoon.</p>
<p>In the flickering lantern light, the expression
on the four faces changed from eager excitement
to genuine disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a clue among them,&rdquo; Dora announced
dramatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a line of writing of any kind, is there?&rdquo;
Mary was confident that she knew the answer
to her question before she asked it.</p>
<p>Dick was closely scrutinizing the empty
leather box. &ldquo;Usually in mystery stories,&rdquo; he
looked up from his inspection to say, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
a lining in the trunk and the lost will, or, what
have you, is safely reposing under it, but unfortunately
Little Bodil&rsquo;s trunk has no lining
nor hide-it-away places of any kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary was holding the small doll near to the
lantern and the others saw tears in her pitying
blue eyes. Suddenly she held the doll comfortingly
close as she said, a sob in her voice,
&ldquo;Poor little old wooden dollie, all these long
years you&rsquo;ve been waiting, wondering, perhaps,
why Little Bodil didn&rsquo;t take you out and
mother you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like Eugene Fields&rsquo; &lsquo;Little Toy Dog,&rsquo;&rdquo;
Dora said, looking lovingly at her friend. Then,
&ldquo;Mary, you can write the sweetest verses.
Someday when we&rsquo;re back at school, write
about Little Bodil&rsquo;s wooden doll. It may make
you famous.&rdquo; Then she modified, &ldquo;At least it
will help you fill space in &lsquo;The Sunnybank
Say-So.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promise to send me a copy if she does,&rdquo;
Jerry said.</p>
<p>Dick, who had not been listening, had at last
given up hope of finding a scrap of writing.
He had felt in the small pocket of the plaid
dress and had closely examined the quilted
hood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said in a matter-of-fact tone,
&ldquo;since there isn&rsquo;t a clue to be found, shall we
put the things back into the trunk and go in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we might as well,&rdquo; Jerry acquiesced.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to be up early tomorrow
so that we can drive the girls over to Gleeson
along about noon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>Dora was examining the hand-carved wooden
bowl and long wooden spoon. &ldquo;I wonder if
Little Bodil&rsquo;s father made this leaf pattern on
the handle,&rdquo; she said, then began, jokingly, &ldquo;If
I were a trance medium, I would say, as I hold
this article, I feel the presence of someone who,
when alive in the flesh, dearly loved the child,
Little Bodil. This someone, this spirit presence
that we cannot see with our outward eyes,
wishes very much to help us find a clue.&rdquo;
Dora&rsquo;s voice had become mysteriously low.</p>
<p>Lifting her eyes slowly from the wooden
bowl, she gazed intently at a dark corner where
junk was piled.</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s gaze followed. &ldquo;Goodness, Dora!&rdquo;
she implored nervously, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t stare that way
into space. Anyone would think that you saw
someone and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure but that I do see something.&rdquo;
Dora&rsquo;s tone had changed to one of startled seriousness.
&ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; she continued, pointing
toward the dark corner, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t <i>you</i> see a palely
luminous object over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I do,&rdquo; the cowboy agreed. &ldquo;But
one thing I&rsquo;m sure is, it can&rsquo;t be a ghost since
there isn&rsquo;t any such thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do we know that&mdash;&rdquo; Dora began when
Mary, clutching her friend&rsquo;s arm, whispered
excitedly, &ldquo;I see it now! Oh, Jerry, if it isn&rsquo;t
a ghost, <i>what</i> is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon know.&rdquo; There was no fear in
the cowboy&rsquo;s voice as he leaped to his feet and
walked toward the corner. The girls watched
breathlessly expecting to see the apparition
fade into darkness, but, if anything, it seemed
clearer, as Jerry approached it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>His hearty laugh dispelled their fears before
he explained, &ldquo;The moon is rising. That&rsquo;s
moonlight coming in through a long crack in
the wall.&rdquo; Then, with a shrug which told his
disbelief in <i>all</i> things supernatural, he dismissed
the subject with, &ldquo;I reckon <i>that&rsquo;s</i> as
near being a ghost as anything ever is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary was tenderly placing the coarse little
undergarments back into the small trunk. Dora
less sentimental than her friend, nevertheless
felt a pitying sadness in her heart as she refolded
the little plaid dress and laid it on top.
Before closing the box, Mary, still on her knees,
looked up at Jerry, her eyes luminous. &ldquo;Big
Brother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do <i>you</i> think Little Bodil
would mind if I kept her doll? It&rsquo;s a funny,
homely little thing with only a wooden heart,
but I can&rsquo;t get over feeling that it&rsquo;s lonesome
and needs comforting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s gray eyes were very gentle as he
looked down at the girl. His voice was a bit
husky as he replied, &ldquo;I reckon Little Bodil
would be grateful to you if she knew. She probably
set a store by that doll baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held out a strong brown hand to help her
to rise and there was a tenderness in the clasp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>Dora had not packed the wooden bowl and
spoon. &ldquo;I would so like to keep these,&rdquo; she
said, adding hastily, &ldquo;Of course, if Little Bodil
is found, I&rsquo;ll give them back to her. Don&rsquo;t you
think it would be all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo; Dick replied. Stooping, he
picked up the worn little carpet slippers, saying,
&ldquo;You overlooked these, girls, while you
were packing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so we did.&rdquo; Dora reached up a hand
to take them, then she hesitated, inquiring,
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you and Jerry each take one for a
keepsake, or don&rsquo;t boys care for such things?&rdquo;
Dick took one of the slippers and dropped it,
unconcernedly, into a deep leather pocket. The
other slipper he handed to Jerry who stowed
it away. The boys replaced the cover of the
box, not without difficulty, and then they all
four stood for a silent moment looking down
at it with varying emotions. Mary spoke in a
small awed voice. &ldquo;What shall we do with the
little box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckoned we&rsquo;d leave it here,&rdquo; Jerry
began, then asked, &ldquo;What were <i>you</i> thinking
about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wondering,&rdquo; Mary said, looking from
one to another with large star-like eyes, &ldquo;if it
wouldn&rsquo;t be a good plan to take the box up to
the rock house and leave it <i>there</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mary Moore,&rdquo; Dora was frankly
amazed, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t <i>dare</i> climb up there and
be looked at by that Evil Eye Turquoise,
would you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>Before Mary could reply, Jerry said, &ldquo;The
plan is a good one, all right, but we&rsquo;d better
leave it here, I reckon, till we know if there&rsquo;s
any way to get up to the rock house. The cliff
that broke off in front of it used to be Mr.
Pedersen&rsquo;s stairway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary agreed and so they ascended the wall
ladder. As they stood in the harness-room
below, Mary said in a low voice, &ldquo;Although
we have <i>not</i> found a clue, that trunk has done
one thing; it has made me feel in my heart that
Little Bodil was a <i>real</i> child. Before, it seemed
to me more like a fanciful story. Now, more
than ever, I hope that <i>somewhere</i> we will find
a clue that will someday prove to us that no
harm came to the little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry had picked up the second lantern and,
taking Mary&rsquo;s arm, he led her through the low
door and along the dark path. Neither spoke.
Dora and Dick followed, walking single file.
Dora, remembering the dead snakes, glanced
about, but Mr. Newcomb had thoughtfully
buried them, not wishing the girls to be needlessly
startled.</p>
<p>At the kitchen door, the boys said good night
and returned to their bunk house out near the
corral.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><br />CHAPTER XVII
<br />A WOODEN DOLL</h2>
<p>The girls, with the lantern Jerry had given
them, tip-toed through the darkened hall to
their bedroom. Mary placed the lantern on the
table, and, after having kissed the little wooden
doll good night, she put it to bed on a cushioned
chair. She smiled wistfully up at Dora. &ldquo;What
is there about even a poor forlorn homely
wooden doll that stirs in one&rsquo;s heart a sort of
mother love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ve answered your own question,&rdquo;
Dora replied in her matter-of-fact tone.
&ldquo;I never felt that way about dolls. In fact, I
never owned one after the cradle-age.&rdquo; Then,
fearing that Mary would think that she was
critical of her sentiment, she hurried on to say,
&ldquo;I always wanted tom-boy, noisy toys that I
could romp around with.&rdquo; Then, gazing lovingly
at Mary, she added, &ldquo;Someday you&rsquo;ll
make a wonderful mother. I hope you&rsquo;ll want
to name one of your little girls after me. How
would Dorabelle do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; Mary smiled her approval of the
name. &ldquo;There must be four girls so that the
oldest may have my mother&rsquo;s name and the
other three be called Dorabelle, Patsy and
Polly. What&rsquo;s more, I hope each one will grow
up to be just like her name-mother, if there is
any such thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later, when they were nestled
in the soft bed, Dora asked in a low voice,
&ldquo;What kind of a man would you like to
marry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s thoughts had again wandered back
to Little Bodil and so she replied indifferently,
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve never thought that far.
I <i>do</i> want a home and children, someday, of
course, but first, for a <i>long</i> time, I hope, I&rsquo;m
going to keep house for Daddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora was more than ever convinced that
Mary thought of the cowboy merely as the Big
Brother, which so frequently she called him.
However, before entirely giving up, she asked,
&ldquo;If you have little boys, what will you name
<i>them</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary laughed, not at all suspecting her
friend&rsquo;s real reason for all the questioning.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an easy one to answer,&rdquo; she said artlessly.
&ldquo;The oldest, of course, will be named
after Dad. The other two&mdash;if&mdash;why, Dick and
Jerry will do as well as any, and yet,&rdquo; she
paused and seemed to think a bit, then merrily
she said, &ldquo;Dora, let&rsquo;s postpone all this christening
for ten years at least. The fond father of
the brood may want to have a finger in the
pie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>Dora thought, &ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s voice sounds amused.
Maybe she&rsquo;s wise to my scheming. I&rsquo;d better
soft pedal it, if I&rsquo;m ever going to get at the
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aloud she said with elaborate indifference&mdash;yawning
to add to the effect, &ldquo;Oh, well, it really
doesn&rsquo;t matter. After all I had quite forgotten
our agreement to both remain old maids, me
to teach school and you to keep house for me.&rdquo;
Again she yawned, saying sleepily, &ldquo;Good night
and pleasant dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was daybreak when the girls woke up. Already
there were sounds of activity within and
without. Barnyard fowls were clamoring, each
in its own way, for the breakfast which Dick
was carrying to them.</p>
<p>Jerry&mdash;in the cow corral&mdash;was milking under
difficulties as a long-legged calf was noisily demanding
a share.</p>
<p>From the kitchen came faintly the clatter
of dishes, a sizzling sound and a most appetizing
fragrance of coffee, bacon and frying
potatoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get up and surprise the boys,&rdquo; Mary
whispered.</p>
<p>This they did and were in time to help
pleased Mrs. Newcomb carry in the hot viands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>Jerry and Dick welcomed them with delighted
grins and Mr. Newcomb gave them each
a fatherly pat as he passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will you girls spend the morning?&rdquo;
Jerry inquired. &ldquo;Dick and I have branding
to do and I reckon you wouldn&rsquo;t care to &lsquo;spectate&rsquo;
as an old cowboy we once had used to
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary shuddered. &ldquo;I <i>certainly do not</i>,&rdquo; she
declared. &ldquo;I hope branding doesn&rsquo;t hurt the
poor calf half as much as it would hurt <i>me</i> to
watch it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing that gets me,&rdquo; Dick, still a tenderfoot,
commented, &ldquo;is the smell of burning
hair and flesh. I can&rsquo;t get used to it.&rdquo; Then,
glancing half apologetically toward Mrs. Newcomb,
he said, &ldquo;Not a very nice breakfast subject,
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Placidly that good woman replied, &ldquo;On a
ranch one gets used to unappetizing subjects&mdash;sort
of like nurses do in hospitals, I suppose.
During meals is about all the time cowmen have
to talk over what they&rsquo;ve been doing and make
plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told us yet what you&rsquo;d like to
do this morning,&rdquo; Jerry said, as he glanced
fondly at the curly, sun-gold head close to his
shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>Mary replied, with a quick eager glance at
the older woman, &ldquo;Aunt Mollie, can&rsquo;t you make
use of two very capable young women? We can
sweep and dust and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to!&rdquo; was the laughing reply. &ldquo;Yesterday
was clean-up day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do some wicked churning,&rdquo; Dora assured
their hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sour cream ready, dearie.&rdquo; Then, realizing
that the girls truly wished to be of assistance,
Mrs. Newcomb turned brightly toward her
son. &ldquo;Jerry, I wish you&rsquo;d saddle a couple of
horses before you go. I&rsquo;d like to send a parcel
over to Etta Dooley. What&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;d like
Mary and Dora to meet Etta. She&rsquo;s about your
age, dear.&rdquo; She had turned toward Mary. &ldquo;A
fine girl, we think, but a mighty lonesome one,
yet <i>never</i> a word of complaint. She has four
to cook for&mdash;five counting herself&mdash;and beside
that, there&rsquo;s the patching and the cleaning.
Then in between times she&rsquo;s studying to try
to pass the Douglas high school examinations,
hoping someday to be a teacher. You&rsquo;ll both
like Etta. Don&rsquo;t you think they will, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I reckon she&rsquo;s likeable,&rdquo; the cowboy
said indifferently. He was thinking how much
more enthusiasm he could have put into that
reply if his mother had asked, &ldquo;Etta will like
Mary, won&rsquo;t she, Jerry?&rdquo; Rising, he smiled
down at the girl of whom he was thinking. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
go and saddle Dusky for you,&rdquo; he told her.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s as easy riding as a rocking horse and
as pretty a creature as we ever had on <i>Bar N</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>When the boys were gone, the girls insisted
on washing the breakfast dishes. Then they
made their beds. As they expected, they found
the saddled ponies waiting for them near the
side door.</p>
<p>Mrs. Newcomb gave Mary a flat, soft parcel.
&ldquo;Slip it over your saddle horn, dear,&rdquo; she suggested,
&ldquo;and tell Etta that the flannel in the
parcel is for her to make into nighties for Baby
Bess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dusky was as beautiful a horse as Jerry had
said. Graceful, slender-limbed, with a coat of
soft gray-black velvet&mdash;the color of dusk.
Dora&rsquo;s mount was named &ldquo;Old Reliable.&rdquo; Mrs.
Newcomb smoothed its near flank lovingly. &ldquo;I
used to ride this one all over the range, and
even into town, when we were both younger,&rdquo;
she told them.</p>
<p>The girls cantered leisurely down the cottonwood
shaded lane and then turned, not toward
the right which led to the highway, but toward
the left on a rough canyon road that ascended
gradually up a low tree-covered mountain.</p>
<p>Brambly bushes grew along the trail showing
that the ground was not entirely dry. A
curve in the road revealed the reason. A wide,
stony creek-bed was ahead of them, and, in
the middle of it, was a crystal-clear, rushing
stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>The horses waded through the water spatteringly.
Old Reliable seemed not to notice the
little whirlpools at his feet, but Dusky put back
his ears and did a bit of side stepping. Mary,
unafraid, spoke gently and patted his glossy
neck. With a graceful leap, the bank was
reached. There was a steep scramble for both
horses; loose rock rattled down to the brook
bed.</p>
<p>When they were on the rutty, climbing road
again, Dora laughingly remarked, &ldquo;Dusky already
knows the voice of his mistress.&rdquo; If there
was a hidden meaning in Dora&rsquo;s remark, Mary
did not notice it, for what she said was, &ldquo;Dora,
who would ever expect a cowboy to be poetic,
but Jerry surely was when he named this horse,
don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; Dora replied inelegantly. To herself
she thought, &ldquo;That may be a hopeful sign,
thinking Jerry is a poet in cowboy guise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lovely up this canyon road, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
All unconsciously Mary was gazing about her,
contentedly drinking in the beauty of the cool,
shadowy, rocky places on either side. Aspen,
ash and cottonwood trees grew tall, their long
roots drawing moisture from the tumbling
brook.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>Half a mile up the canyon there was a clearing,
and in it stood a very old log hut with
adobe-filled cracks. A lean-to on one side had
recently been put up. In a small, fenced-in
yard were a dozen hens, and down nearer the
brook was a garden patch. Two small, red-headed
boys in overalls were there busily weeding.
Near them, on a grassy plot, a spotted cow
was tethered. Back of the house, hanging on
a line, was a rather nondescript wash, but,
nevertheless, it was clean.</p>
<p>The front door stood open but no one was
in sight. Mary and Dora, leaving the road,
turned their horses toward the small house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sort of queer,&rdquo; Mary said, &ldquo;sort of
story-bookish&mdash;coming to call on a strange girl
in this romantic canyon and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-ss!&rdquo; Dora warned. &ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s coming
to the door.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><br />CHAPTER XVIII
<br />A STRANGE HOSTESS</h2>
<p>Etta Dooley, evidently unused to receiving
calls, stood in the open door, her rather
sad mouth and her fine hazel eyes unsmiling.
Her plain brown cloth dress hid the graceful
lines of her young form. She was wondering
and waiting.</p>
<p>Mary and Dora dismounted, and, as the red-headed,
ten-year-old twins had come pell-mell
from the garden, Mary, smiling down at them
in her captivating way, asked them not to let
the horses wander far from the house. Then,
with the same irresistible smile, she approached
the still silent, solemn girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Etta,&rdquo; Mary said brightly,
pretending not to notice the other girl&rsquo;s rather
disconcerting gaze. &ldquo;We are friends of Mrs.
Newcomb, and she wanted us to become acquainted
with you. I am Mary Moore. I live
in Gleeson across the valley and Dora Bellman
is my best friend from the East.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Etta&rsquo;s serious face lighted for a brief moment
with a rather melancholy smile as she
acknowledged the introduction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>Dora thought, &ldquo;Poor girl, if <i>that&rsquo;s</i> the best
she can do, how cruel life must have been to
her, yet she isn&rsquo;t any older than we are, I am
sure. I wish we could make her forget for a
moment. I&rsquo;d like to see her really smile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Etta had stepped to one side and was saying
in her grave, musical voice, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you
come in?&rdquo; Then a dark red flush suffused her
tanned face as she added, not without embarrassment,
&ldquo;Though there aren&rsquo;t two safe chairs
for you to sit on. The children made them,
such as they are, out of boxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary, ever able to blithely cope with any situation,
exclaimed sincerely, &ldquo;Oh, Etta, it&rsquo;s so
gloriously lovely outdoors today, let&rsquo;s sit here.
I&rsquo;ll take the stump and you two may have the
fallen tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as Etta glanced back into the room,
half hesitating, Mary asked, &ldquo;Were you busy
about something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing special,&rdquo; Etta replied. &ldquo;I wanted
to see if we had wakened Baby Bess. She sleeps
late and I like to have her.&rdquo; Again the hazel
eyes were sad. The reason was given. &ldquo;She
hasn&rsquo;t been well since Mother died.&rdquo; There
was a sudden fierce tenderness in her voice as
she added, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t lose Baby Bess. She&rsquo;s so
like our mother.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Then, as though amazed at her own unusual
show of feeling before strangers, Etta sank
down on the log and shut herself away from
them behind a wall of reserve.</p>
<p>But Mary, baffled though she momentarily
was, knew that Aunt Mollie was counting on
the good their friendship would do Etta, and
so, glancing about, she exclaimed, &ldquo;I love that
rushing brook! It seems so happy, sparkling
in the sun and singing all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora helped out with, &ldquo;This surely is a
beauty spot here under the trees. It&rsquo;s the prettiest
place I&rsquo;ve seen since I&rsquo;ve been in Arizona.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it,&rdquo; Etta said, then with unexpected
tenseness she added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love it, oh, <i>how</i> I&rsquo;d
love it, if it were our own and not <i>charity</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora thought, &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re getting at the
down-deepness of things. Poor, but so proud!
I wonder who in the world these Dooleys are.
The name doesn&rsquo;t suggest nobility.&rdquo; But aloud
she asked no questions. One just didn&rsquo;t ask
Etta about her personal affairs.</p>
<p>Dora groped for something that she could
say that would start the conversational ball
rolling, but, for once, she had a most unusual
dearth of ideas.</p>
<p>Luckily there came a welcome break in the
silence which was becoming embarrassing to
the kindly intentioned visitors.</p>
<p>A sweet trilling baby-voice called, &ldquo;Etta, I&rsquo;se
&rsquo;wake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>Instantly their strange hostess was on her
feet, her eyes love-lighted, her voice eager.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring her out. It&rsquo;s warm here in the sunshine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Etta was gone, Mary and Dora exchanged
despairing glances which seemed to
say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come to a hurdle that we can&rsquo;t
jump over.&rdquo; Aloud they said nothing, for, almost
at once Etta reappeared. In her arms
was a two-year-old; a pretty child with sleep-flushed
cheeks, corn-flower blue eyes and tousled
hair as yellow as cornsilk. Etta&rsquo;s expression
told her love and pride in her little darling.</p>
<p>Baby Bess gazed unsmilingly at Dora as
though she knew that here was someone who
did not care for dolls, then she turned to look
at Mary. Instantly she leaned toward her and
held out both chubby arms, her sudden smile
sweet and trusting.</p>
<p>Dora, watching Etta, saw a fleeting change
of expression. What was it? Could Etta be
jealous? But no, it wasn&rsquo;t that, for she gave
Mary her first real smile of friendship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baby Bess likes you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That
means you must be <i>very</i> nice. Would you like
to hold her?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; Dora thought as she watched
Mary reseating herself on the stump and
gathering the small child into her arms, &ldquo;I
reckon then I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, with the child contentedly nestling
in Mary&rsquo;s arms, the ice melted in the conversational
stream. Of her own accord Etta
spoke of school. She asked how far along the
girls were and astonished them by telling what
she was doing, subjects far in advance of them.</p>
<p>Then came the surprising information that
her father and mother had both been college
graduates and had taught her. She had never
attended a school. She in turn taught the twins.
Then, in a burst of confidence which Dora
rightly guessed was very foreign to her reserved
nature, Etta said, &ldquo;My father lost a
fortune four years ago. He made very unwise
investments. After that Mother&rsquo;s health failed
and we came West. Dad did not know how to
earn money. He grew old very suddenly,&rdquo;
then, once again, despair made her face far
older than her years. She threw her arms wide.
&ldquo;All this tells the rest of our story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s blue eyes held tears of sympathy
which she hid in the child&rsquo;s yellow curls. Etta
would not want sympathy.</p>
<p>Luckily at that moment there came a welcome
interruption. A gay hallooing lower down
the road announced the approach of Dick and
Jerry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>Dora could see Etta rebuilding her wall of
reserve. She acknowledged the introduction to
Dick with a formal, unsmiling bow. Baby Bess
kept the situation from becoming awkward by
welcoming Jerry with delighted crows and
leaps. The tall cowboy, his sombrero pushed
back on his head, took her in his strong hands
and lifted her high. The child&rsquo;s gurgling excited
laughter was like the rippling laughter of the
mountain brook. After a few moments Jerry
gave the baby to Etta. The twins came around
a clump of cottonwood trees leading the horses,
their freckled faces bright with wide grins,
their Irish blue eyes laughing. Not for them
the anxiety and sorrow that so crushed their
big sister.</p>
<p>Jerry tossed them coins to pay them for the
care they had taken of the ponies. Dora, glancing
quickly at Etta, saw that the troubled expression
was again brooding in her eyes.</p>
<p>Later, when Mary and Dora had said goodbye
to their new friend and were riding away
up the canyon road, Dora said, &ldquo;Jerry, doesn&rsquo;t
it seem queer to you that the boys are so different
from their sister? I should almost think
that <i>she</i> belonged to an entirely different family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A changeling, perhaps,&rdquo; Dick suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me no sabe,&rdquo; the cowboy replied lightly.
He was thinking of a very pleasant dream of
his own just then.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>Mary said with fervor, &ldquo;Anyway, <i>whoever</i>
she is, I think she is a darling girl and the baby
is adorable. I wish that we lived nearer that
we might see her oftener, Dora.&rdquo; Then, before
her friend could reply, Mary added brightly,
&ldquo;Oh, Jerry, I know where you are taking us.
You want to show Dick your own five hundred
acres, don&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;s the loveliest spot in all
the country round, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s gray eyes brightened. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what
I <i>hoped</i> you would think, Little Sister,&rdquo; he said
in a low voice, which the other two, following,
could not hear.</p>
<p>They had gone about half a mile up the winding,
slowly climbing road when Jerry stopped.
The mountain had flattened out in a wide grass-covered
tableland moistened by many underground
springs.</p>
<p>Jerry waved his left hand. &ldquo;This all was
blue and yellow with wild flowers after the
spring rains,&rdquo; he told them. Mary turned her
horse off the road and went to the edge of the
hurrying brook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Dick,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;this is where Jerry
is going to build him a house some day. His
granddad willed it to him. It takes in the part
of the canyon where the Dooleys are, doesn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Close to it,&rdquo; Jerry replied. &ldquo;Their garden
is on my line, but Dad and I will never put up
fences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; Dora exclaimed. &ldquo;Since
you are the only child, it will all be yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a jolly fine view from here,&rdquo; Dick
said admiringly as he sat on his horse gazing
across the valley to the far range beyond Gleeson.</p>
<p>As they rode back down the valley Dora was
thinking, &ldquo;How can Mary help knowing that
Jerry hopes that <i>she</i> will be the one to live in
the house he plans building?&rdquo; Then, with a
little shrug, her thought ended with, &ldquo;Oh well,
and oh well, the future will reveal all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down the road Mary was saying, &ldquo;Jerry, I
didn&rsquo;t give that flannel to Etta. I just couldn&rsquo;t.
I was afraid she would think that we had come
<i>only</i> for charitable reasons. Of course we did
in the beginning, but, afterwards, I was <i>so</i> glad
something had given me a chance to meet her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A solution was offered by the sudden appearance
of the twins by the roadside.</p>
<p>Jerry, slipping the parcel from Mary&rsquo;s
saddle horn, tossed it down, calling, &ldquo;This is
for Baby Bess, tell Sister Etta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary flashed him a bright, relieved smile as
they went on down the canyon road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><br />CHAPTER XIX
<br />A GUN SHOT</h2>
<p>Early that afternoon Jerry and Dick drove
the small car around to the side door of the
ranch house and hallooed for the girls, who
appeared, one on either side of a beaming Aunt
Mollie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a wonderful time, you dear.&rdquo;
Mary kissed the older woman&rsquo;s tanned cheek
lovingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spiffy-fine!&rdquo; Dora&rsquo;s dark glowing eyes
seconded the enthusiasm of the remark.
&ldquo;Please ask us again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any time, no one <i>could</i> be more welcome,
and make it soon.&rdquo; After the girls had run
down to the car, Mrs. Newcomb turned back
into the kitchen where she was keeping Mr.
Newcomb&rsquo;s mid-day meal warm as he had not
yet returned from riding the range.</p>
<p>The boys leaped out and Jerry opened the
front door with a flourish. He glanced at Mary
suspiciously. &ldquo;You girls look as though you
were plotting mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not that,&rdquo; Mary denied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just been
composing Verse Eight for our Cowboy Song.
You know they have to be forty verses long.
Ready, Dora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then together they laughingly sang&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Two jolly girls and cowboys twain</p>
<p class="t0">Start out adventuring once again.</p>
<p class="t4">Come, come, coma,</p>
<p class="t4">Coma, coma, kee.</p>
<p class="t4">Come, come, coma,</p>
<p class="t5">Come with we.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not so hot!&rdquo; Dick commented. &ldquo;Wait till
I&rsquo;ve had time to cook up one. Jerry, we&rsquo;ll do
Verse Nine after awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive fast enough to cool us, won&rsquo;t you,
Jerry, for it surely <i>is</i> torrid today,&rdquo; Dora
urged as she sprang nimbly into the rumble
followed by Dick. &ldquo;You two have your heads
sheltered but we poor exposed pussons are
likely to have frizzled brains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick, sinking down as comfortably as possible
in the rather cramped quarters, grinned
at his companion affably. &ldquo;Luckily for us Jerry
didn&rsquo;t hear that or he would have sprung that
old one, &lsquo;what makes you think you have
any?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora turned toward him rather blankly.
&ldquo;Any what?&rdquo; she questioned, then added
quickly, &ldquo;Oh, of course, brains. I was wondering
what those cows, that are watching us so
intently, think that we are.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some four-headed, square-bodied fierce animal
that rattles all its bones when it runs, I
suspect, and if they could hear Jerry&rsquo;s horn,
they&rsquo;d take to the high timber up around the
Dooleys&rsquo; clearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Dora became serious. &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t that Etta a strange, interesting
girl? Would you call her beautiful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t call her at all,&rdquo; Dick said sententiously;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite satisfied with my present
companion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ignoring his facetiousness, Dora continued,
&ldquo;Etta told us that her father lost a fortune
four years ago. He evidently had inherited it.
He couldn&rsquo;t have made it himself, because,
when it was lost, he was simply helpless. He
didn&rsquo;t know how to work and earn more. That
implies that he belonged to a rich family,
doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly. In fact probably,&rdquo; Dick agreed,
looking with mock solemnity through his shell-rimmed
glasses at the interested, olive-tinted
face of his companion. &ldquo;Is all this leading
somewhere? Do you think that there <i>may</i> be
rich relatives who ought to be notified of the
Dooleys&rsquo; plight?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>Dora laughed as she acknowledged that she
hadn&rsquo;t thought that far. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid
we&rsquo;ll get sort of mixed up if we try to solve
two mysteries at once?&rdquo; Dick continued. &ldquo;You
know we&rsquo;re already hot on the trail of a clue
that will unravel the Lucky Loon&mdash;Little Bodil
mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora turned brightly toward him. &ldquo;Dick
Farley,&rdquo; she announced, as one who had made
an important discovery, &ldquo;here <i>is</i> something!
Little Bodil is described as having had deep
blue eyes and cornsilk yellow hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing, what of it? Etta&rsquo;s hair is dark
brown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking about that Baby Bess, silly!&rdquo;
Dora told him. &ldquo;Surely you noticed that she
had&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hair and eyes? Sure thing!&rdquo; Dick finished
her sentence jokingly, &ldquo;but, according to my
rather limited observation of the infant terrible,
it usually starts life with blue eyes and
yellow hair. Now are you going to tell me that
this baby and Little Bodil have another similarity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora had turned and was looking out over
the desert valley, which, for the past half hour,
they had been crossing. Dick thought she was
offended by his good-natured raillery, but, if
she had been, she thought better of it and replied,
&ldquo;I had not noticed any other similarity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, neither had I,&rdquo; Dick, wishing to mollify
her, confessed, &ldquo;except that both of their
names start with B.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>The small car had turned on the cross road
which led toward Gleeson. As they neared the
high cliff-like gate which was the entrance to
the box-shaped sandy front yard of Mr. Pedergen&rsquo;s
rock house and tomb, Dick leaned forward
and called, &ldquo;Hi there, Jerry! Dora suggests
that we stop and visit Lucky Loon&rsquo;s estate.
We aren&rsquo;t in any particular hurry, are
we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rattling of the car was stilled as Jerry
drew to one side of the road and stopped. He
got out and glanced up at the sun. It still
was high in a gleaming blue sky. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hours
yet before milking time,&rdquo; he replied. Then to
Mary, &ldquo;What is <i>your</i> wish, Little Sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora thought, &ldquo;<i>Never</i> a brother in all this
world puts so much tenderness into <i>that</i> name.
Leastwise <i>mine</i> don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary had evidently replied that she would
like to revisit the rock house, for Jerry was assisting
her from the car. Dick had learned
from past experience that Dora scorned assistance.
Two girls could <i>not</i> be more unlike.</p>
<p>Before they entered the rock gate, Dick implored
with pretended earnestness, &ldquo;For Pete&rsquo;s
sake, don&rsquo;t any of you imagine you hear a gun
shot, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless we really <i>do</i> hear one,&rdquo; Mary
said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>Dora, to be impish, declared, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m prophesying
that we <i>will</i> hear a gun fired before we
leave this enclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sand was deep and the walking was hard.
Jerry, with a hand under Mary&rsquo;s right elbow,
helped her along, but Dora ploughed alone,
with Dick, making no better headway, at her
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we first visited this place,&rdquo; Dora
began, &ldquo;I felt that there was sort of a deathlike
atmosphere about it. It&rsquo;s so terribly still
and with bleached skeletons lying around. Now
that I <i>know</i> it is Lucky Loon&rsquo;s tomb,&rdquo; she
glanced up at the rock house and shuddered,
&ldquo;it seems more uncanny than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick, having left the others, wandered along
the base of the cliff on which stood the rock
house. The front of it had broken away leaving
a wide gap at the top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where Lucky Loon went up, I suppose.&rdquo;
Dick pointed to irregular steps that
seemed to have been hewn out of the leaning
rock. &ldquo;We <i>could</i> go up these stairs to the top
of this rock, but nothing short of a mountain
goat could leap that chasm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Jerry agreed.</p>
<p>Dick was regarding the gap speculatively.
&ldquo;If a fellow could throw a rope from the top
of this leaning rock over to the house and make
it secure somehow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>Dora teasingly interrupted, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,
Doctor Dick, that <i>you</i> could walk a tight rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh sure, I can do anything I set out to!&rdquo;
was the joking reply. &ldquo;However, I meant to
walk across it with my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be done.&rdquo; The cowboy shook his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; Dick declared, &ldquo;you all wait here
while I see how far up these old stairs I can
climb. From the top I can better estimate how
big a goat will be required to carry me over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; Mary laughed, &ldquo;I never knew you
to be so nonsensical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora tried to detain him, saying, &ldquo;If you
succeed in climbing up to the top of this leaning
rock, you <i>might</i> be directly opposite the
open door of the rock house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what of it!&rdquo; Dick was puzzled, for
Dora&rsquo;s expression was serious and almost fearful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Evil Eye Turquoise <i>might</i> look right
out at you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Surely <i>you</i> don&rsquo;t believe <i>that</i> yarn!&rdquo; Dick
smiled down at her from the first step, for he
had started to climb. He reached up to catch
at a higher step with one hand when he uttered
a terrorized scream and fairly dropped back
to the ground, his arm held out. Clinging to
his coat sleeve, perilously close to his wrist,
was a huge lizard, a Gila Monster, thick-bodied,
hideously mottled, dull-yellow, orange-red,
dead-black. It had a blunt head and short legs
that were clawing the air. The girls echoed
Dick&rsquo;s scream. Jerry, leaping forward, gave a
warning cry. &ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t drop your arm!</i>&rdquo; Then
the quick command, &ldquo;<i>Girls, get back of me!</i>&rdquo;
Whipping out his gun, he fired. The ugly reptile
dropped to the sand, its muscles convulsing.</p>
<p>Dora ran to Dick and pulled back his sleeve.
&ldquo;Thank heavens,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t touch
your wrist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;ve had a narrow escape all
right, old man,&rdquo; Jerry declared, his tone one
of great relief. Then, self-rebukingly, &ldquo;I
ought to have warned you. <i>Never</i> put your feet
or your hands <i>anywhere</i> that you can&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose there&rsquo;s any poison in my
coat sleeve?&rdquo; Dick asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I reckon not,&rdquo; the cowboy said. &ldquo;A Gila
Monster packs his poison in his lower jaw and
he has to turn over on his back before he can
get it into a wound he makes.&rdquo; Then, glancing
at Mary and seeing that she still looked white
and was trembling, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s
go. I reckon it&rsquo;s too hot in here at this hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora, hardly knowing that she did so, clung
to Dick&rsquo;s arm as they waded through the sand
to the gate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how I do hope we&rsquo;ll never, <i>never</i> have
to come to this awful place again,&rdquo; Mary said.
&ldquo;To think that Dick might have lost his life
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Dick replied. Then, with
an effort at levity, he added, &ldquo;Dora, <i>you won</i>!
We <i>did</i> hear a gun shot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><br />CHAPTER XX
<br />INTRODUCING AN AIR SCOUT</h2>
<p>As they were nearing Gleeson, Dick leaned
forward and called, &ldquo;Jerry, Dora and I were
wondering if we ought to tell old Silas Harvey
that we have found Little Bodil&rsquo;s trunk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not until the small car had climbed the last
ascending stretch of road to the tableland and
had stopped in front of the ancient corner store
did he receive a reply. Then, jumping out,
Jerry said in a low voice, &ldquo;Mary and I have
been talking it over and we reckon that we&rsquo;d
better wait awhile before telling.&rdquo; Then to the
girl on the front seat, &ldquo;Shall I get your mail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mine! And mine!&rdquo; a chorus from the
rumble.</p>
<p>There were letters and papers but one that
especially pleased the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another bulgy-budget from Polly and
Patsy,&rdquo; Dora exulted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re our two best friends back East at
Sunnybank-on-the-Hudson where I live.&rdquo; This
she explained to Dick as the little car started
to rattle up the hill road through the deserted
ghost town.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you the rest,&rdquo; Dick recited.
&ldquo;Polly is fat and jolly and eats chocolates by
the box. Patsy is clever, red-headed and a boy-hater.
Have I got it right? Anyway I&rsquo;m sure
that&rsquo;s what you said the first time you told me
about them. Oh, yes&mdash;all together you call yourselves
&lsquo;The Quadralettes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto. Go to the head of the class. Although
you did draw one minus. Patsy is no
longer a boy-hater. She&rsquo;s met her conqueror.
Or at least so their last letter reported. I&rsquo;m
wild to get home so that we may read this.&rdquo;
Then leaning forward, she called through the
opening in the old top which covered the front
seat, &ldquo;Jerry, can&rsquo;t you boys stay awhile? I&rsquo;d
like to share this letter with you and Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, please do,&rdquo; Mary seconded
brightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it isn&rsquo;t time yet to milk
that cow.&rdquo; This was teasingly added, remembering
what Jerry had said soon after the noon
hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to plead, Little Sister,&rdquo;
Jerry smiled down into the eager, upturned
face that looked so fair to him; &ldquo;if it was time
to milk the cow, I reckon I&rsquo;d let the calf do it.
We only need milk enough for the family and
this morning Bossie was extra generous.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>When the Moore house was reached, Mary,
anxious to see her dad, hurried indoors and
went directly to his room. He had just awakened
from his nap and looked so much better
that Mary exclaimed gladly, &ldquo;Dad, you&rsquo;ll be
sitting out on the porch next week. I&rsquo;m just
ever so sure that you will.&rdquo; Then, to the nurse
who had entered, &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Farley, isn&rsquo;t Dad
wonderfully improved? Don&rsquo;t you think he&rsquo;ll
be well enough to go back East with me in October
when school opens?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it!&rdquo; the kind woman replied,
then, dismissing the girl, she added, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time
for the alcohol rub, dearie. Come back at four
and you may read to your dad until supper
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I surely will.&rdquo; For a long moment
Mary&rsquo;s rosebud cheek pressed the thin wan one
she so loved, then she slipped away.</p>
<p>Dick had spoken with his mother a brief
moment when Mary had first gone in and she
had been pleased to see the deepening tan on
his face. The boy had not told her of his recent
narrow escape, as Jerry had called it when
the Gila Monster had set its cruel jaws on his
coat sleeve. Brave as he was, Dick could not
recall the terror of that moment without experiencing
it all over again. He was sure he
would have nightmares about it for a long time
to come.</p>
<p>When Dora tripped down from upstairs
where she had been to tidy up, she found Dick
waiting for her in the lower hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the two Erries?&rdquo; she asked, then
laughed as he looked mystified. &ldquo;Mary and
Jerry. Of course if it were spelled Merry, it
would be better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the kitchen,&rdquo; Dick replied. &ldquo;I was told
to guide you thence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They heard spoons rattling in glasses. &ldquo;Oh,
good!&rdquo; Dora exclaimed. &ldquo;That sounds like a
nice, cool drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor was she wrong. There at the table in
the shady corner of the kitchen stood Mary
mixing fruit juices she had poured from cans
which Jerry had opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yum! Yum!&rdquo; Dora exclaimed in high appreciation.
&ldquo;What is better than pineapple and
strawberry juice and cold water from the
spring cellar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds good to me,&rdquo; Dick said, smacking
his lips with anticipatory relish.</p>
<p>Mary called over her shoulder, &ldquo;Dora, fetch
some of Carmelita&rsquo;s cookie snaps.&rdquo; Then, as
she placed the four tall glasses around the
table, she added, &ldquo;Sit wherever you want to.
When the party is over, we&rsquo;ll read the letter.&rdquo;
The refreshment lived up to its name and
tasted even better than it looked. Dick, being
on the outside, cleared away the things and
Dora opened the letter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>The languid scrawl which so fitted Polly&rsquo;s
indolent personality was first in evidence,
&ldquo;Dear Absent Ones,&rdquo; Dora read aloud&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greetings from Camp Winnichook in the
Adirondacks&mdash;(so cool that we have to wear
our sweater coats)&mdash;to the sizzling sands of
desert Arizona.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Patsy&rsquo;s quick, jerky penmanship interrupted.
&ldquo;Crickets, just reading that made
me wipe my freckled brow. Ain&rsquo;t it awful?
Those reddish brown dots that were so piquant
on my pert pug nose have soared to my brow,
spread to my ears, and dived to my chin. But,
even with my beauty thus blemished, H. H.
thinks I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big sprawling words cut in with, &ldquo;It must
be a case of love them and leave them then,
for his winged lordship is about to fly away.&rdquo;
There was a blot of ink at that point as though
there had been a struggle over the pen. Evidently
Patsy had won, as her small scratchy
penmanship followed. &ldquo;Since H. H. is <i>my</i>
friend, I consider it my sacred right to reveal
all. Harry Hulbert, surely you remember all
about him and his perfectly spiffy silver plane,
which honestly looks like a big seagull. Oh,
misery! I&rsquo;m getting all tangled up. What I&rsquo;m
trying to say is that we had told you that he&rsquo;s
studying to be a pilot and that when he got his
papers, he was to fly West and be an air scout.
Well, he&rsquo;s had &rsquo;em and he&rsquo;s done gone! The
whole object of this epistle is to introduce you
to Harry before he drops down upon you.
Heavens, I hope he won&rsquo;t do it literally.
Wouldn&rsquo;t it be awful to have an airplane crash
through your roof?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>Dora paused and looked glowingly across at
Mary. &ldquo;This flying Apollo is coming to Gleeson,
I judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly disappointed. Of
course I knew it <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> happen, but I <i>did</i>
wish, if <i>he</i> came, he could bring Patsy and
Polly along with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this flying seagull going
to do when he gets here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to be attached to the border
patrol,&rdquo; Mary replied. &ldquo;When there&rsquo;s been a
holdup, of a train or a stage, I suppose, Harry
Hulbert is to fly over that region and watch
for the escaping bandits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jolly!&rdquo; Dick ejaculated. &ldquo;That sounds like
a great kind of an adventure to me. Jerry, let&rsquo;s
welcome him like a long lost brother; then, at
least, he&rsquo;ll take us up in his Seagull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the cowboy could reply Dora had continued
reading, &ldquo;Polly has told you that I&rsquo;m
goofy about H. H. but don&rsquo;t you believe a word
of it. I picked him out for <i>you</i>, Mary, so take
him and be grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>Dora wanted to look up at Jerry, but was
afraid it would be too pointed, so she turned
a page and exclaimed with interest, &ldquo;Aha, <i>here</i>
we have him in person. The Seagull&rsquo;s photograph
no less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was an amusing snapshot. Under it was
written, &ldquo;Patsy Ordelle introducing Harry
Hulbert to Mary Moore and Dora Bellman&mdash;also
the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pert, pretty girl with windblown hair and
laughing eyes was pointing toward the youth
at her side, who, dressed in flying togs, stood
by his ship. He was making a bow, evidently
to acknowledge the introduction, and so his face
was not fully revealed. This was remedied by
another snapshot of the boy alone standing
with one hand on his graceful silver plane. Although
not good looking, really, he had a fine,
sensitive face, was slenderly built and had keen
alert eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll turn the mike over to Polly,&rdquo; the
pert handwriting ended. The languid scrawl
took up the tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I was wrong about Pat&rsquo;s being dippy
about the silver aviator. He&rsquo;s been gone two
days and she&rsquo;s been canoeing with &lsquo;The Poet&rsquo;
from &lsquo;Crow&rsquo;s-Nest-Camp&rsquo; up in the hills from
dawn till dark and even by moonlight. For a
once-was boy-hater, she&rsquo;s going some.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, say hello to Harry for us. He really
is a decent kid. Write us the minute he lands.
Wish I&rsquo;d thought to send you a batch of fudge
I&rsquo;d made. Nuts are just crowded in it. Oh,
well, up so near the sun it would probably have
melted. Tra-la for now.</p>
<p><span class="jr">From Poll and Pat.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Mary looked thoughtfully at, Jerry. &ldquo;If
Harry Hulbert left the Atlantic coast two days
before this letter started, he must be in Arizona
by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon so. A mail pilot makes it in less
than three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora thought, &ldquo;Poor Jerry, I &lsquo;reckon&rsquo; <i>he</i>
didn&rsquo;t like that part about H. H. being donated
to his Mary, but he isn&rsquo;t going to say so, not
Jerry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A small clock on the kitchen shelf back of
the big stove made four little tingling noises.
Mary sprang up. Holding out her hand to the
cowboy, she said, &ldquo;Stay for supper if you think
the calf can milk the cow. I&rsquo;m going to read
to Dad for an hour. Then I&rsquo;ll be back again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><br />CHAPTER XXI
<br />A POSSIBLE CLUE</h2>
<p>At five, which was the invalid&rsquo;s supper hour,
Mary emerged from the living-room and heard
excited voices from behind the closed door of
her father&rsquo;s study across the hall.</p>
<p>Dora, who had been listening for her friend&rsquo;s
footsteps, threw the door wide. Her olive-tinted
face told Mary that something had happened
even before Jerry exclaimed: &ldquo;Little
Sister, come here and see what Dick has found.
We think it&rsquo;s a clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A clue about Little Bodil <i>here</i> in Dad&rsquo;s
study?&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s voice was amazed and doubting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s something Dick himself brought
into the house. Don&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; Dora implored the
boys. &ldquo;See if Mary can guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fair girl gazed thoughtfully at the other
three. Dick, beaming upon her, was holding
something behind his back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm. Let me see.&rdquo; Mary put one slim
white finger against her head, as though trying
to think deeply. Then she laughed merrily.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to seem terribly dumb and drag out
the suspense for you all, but, of course, it&rsquo;s as
plain as the sun on a clear day. Dick only kept
<i>one</i> thing from the trunk, and that one thing
was a small carpet slipper. But I don&rsquo;t see how
<i>that</i> could possibly be a clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, my dear young lady, we will
show you.&rdquo; Dick handed the slipper to her.
&ldquo;First, thrust your dainty fingers into its toe.
Do you find a clue there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I do not.&rdquo; Mary was frankly curious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, turn the slipper over. What do you
see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary turned the small worn slipper wonderingly
and reported, &ldquo;A loose patch.&rdquo; Then,
gleefully, &ldquo;Oh, I know, Dick, that patch is some
kind of coarse paper and on the inside of it,
there&rsquo;s writing. Is that it? Have I guessed
right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dick confessed, &ldquo;you know now as
much as we do. We were just about to remove
the patch when you came in. Jerry, let me take
your knife. I left mine on a fence post over
at <i>Bar N</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four young people stood close to one of
the long windows while Dick cut the coarse
thread that held the patch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do hurry!&rdquo; Dora begged. &ldquo;Your fingers
are all thumbs. Here, let me do that.&rdquo; But
Dick shook his head, saying boyishly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my
slipper, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more stitch and we shall know all,&rdquo;
Jerry said, then, smiling across at Mary, he
asked, &ldquo;What do <i>you</i> reckon that we will
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t guess what&rsquo;s <i>in</i> the letter, of
course,&rdquo; that little maid replied, &ldquo;but it <i>can&rsquo;t</i>
be anything that will tell us whether the child
was eaten up by wild animals or carried off by
bandits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ragged piece of brown paper, which had
evidently been torn from a package wrapping,
was removed and opened. Although there had
been writing on it at one time, it was so blurred
that it was hard to decipher. Mary found a
magnifying glass in her father&rsquo;s desk. Dora,
Dick and Jerry stood with their heads together
back of the younger girl&rsquo;s chair, and when they
thought they had figured a word out correctly,
Mary, seated at the desk, wrote it down. After
half an hour, they had made out only two words
of the message and had guessed at the blurred
signature.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;lonesome&mdash;write&mdash;Miss Burger,</span>
<span class="jr">Gray Bluffs,</span>
<span class="jr">New Mexico.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>There were several other words which they
could not make out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>Mary took the letter, spread it on the desk
before her and gazed intently at it through the
magnifying glass. Then, smiling up at the
others, a twinkle in her eyes, she said, &ldquo;This is
it&mdash;perhaps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Little Bodil,</p>
<p>When you reach the strange place where
you are going, you may be lonesome. If
you are, do write often to your good
friend,</p>
<p><span class="jr">Miss Burger.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon that&rsquo;ll do pretty nigh as well
as anything else,&rdquo; Jerry said. Then, glancing
out of the window at the late afternoon sun,
he grinningly announced that since the calf,
by that time, had milked the cow, he and Dick
would accept Mary&rsquo;s previously given invitation
and stay for supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jerry!&rdquo; Mary stood up and caught hold
of the cowboy&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;I know by the gleam in
your eyes that you think this bit of paper <i>may</i>
be a clue worth following up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I sure do,&rdquo; was the earnest reply. &ldquo;I
reckon this Miss Burger, if we got the name
right, was a friend to the little girl somewhere,
sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we write to her now?&rdquo; Mary dropped
back into the desk chair. &ldquo;If she&rsquo;s living, she
will surely answer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Dick was not yet convinced that it
was a helpful clue, &ldquo;<i>how</i> can Miss Burger
know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stupid!&rdquo; Dora interrupted. &ldquo;Of course
Miss Burger <i>won&rsquo;t</i> know whether Little Bodil
was eaten by wild animals or carried off by
bandits, but <i>if</i> the child lived, it&rsquo;s more than
likely, isn&rsquo;t it, that she <i>did</i> write and tell this
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True enough!&rdquo; Dick agreed. &ldquo;But, Lady
Sleuth, if Bodil wrote Miss Burger telling
where <i>she</i> was, isn&rsquo;t it likely that Mr. Pedersen
also wrote the same woman telling where <i>he</i>
was, and presto, his long search would be over.
He would have found his child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, Dick! You weren&rsquo;t stupid
after all.&rdquo; Dora was properly apologetic. Then,
she added ruefully, &ldquo;Since this clue isn&rsquo;t any
good, we got thrilled up over it for nothing at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry spoke in his slow drawl. &ldquo;I cain&rsquo;t be
sure the clue is no good until we&rsquo;ve heard from
this Miss Burger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well spoken, old man,&rdquo; Dick commended.
&ldquo;If we could send a night-letter, we <i>might</i> have
an answer at once, if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That &lsquo;if&rsquo; looms large,&rdquo; Dora commented
dubiously. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a telegraph office in
<i>this</i> ghost town, and, moreover, Miss Burger
may not be alive and if she is, wouldn&rsquo;t she be
<i>awfully</i> ancient?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily,&rdquo; Mary replied, glancing up
at the others thoughtfully. &ldquo;If Little Bodil <i>is</i>
alive, she will be about fifty. This Miss Burger
may have been a very young woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that night telegram,&rdquo; Jerry said.
&ldquo;We can have one sent out of Tombstone up to
nine o&rsquo;clock. What, say that we ride over there
as soon as we&rsquo;ve had supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; Dick ejaculated. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a
full moon to light us home again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary sprang up and clapped her hands gleefully.
&ldquo;It will be jolly fun anyway. And it
<i>may</i> be a good clue. Come on now, let&rsquo;s storm
the kitchen and help Carmelita. We ought to
start as soon as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>It was early twilight when the faithful little
car (that always seemed just about to fall apart
but which never did) drew up in front of the
combination blacksmith shop-oil station on the
edge of Gleeson.</p>
<p>Seth Tully, one of the grizzled, leathery old-timers,
hobbled out of a small, crumbling adobe
building. It was evident that he was much excited
about something and eager to have someone
to talk to.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy, folks,&rdquo; he began in his high, uncertain,
falsetto voice, &ldquo;I reckon as you-all
heerd how a freight train was held up last night
over in Dead Hoss Gulch.&rdquo; Then, seeing the
boys&rsquo; amazement and the girls&rsquo; dismay, he
went on exultingly, &ldquo;Yes, siree! Thar was bags
of rich ore in one o&rsquo; them cars&mdash;the hindmost
one, an&rsquo;, time take it, if them thar bandits
wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t wise to it. The train allays goes durn
slow along that steep grade climbing up out o&rsquo;
the gulch. Well, sir, <i>what</i> did them bandits
do?&rdquo; The old man was becoming dramatic in
his delight at having such thrilled listeners.
&ldquo;Dum blast it, if a parcel of &rsquo;em didn&rsquo;t hold up
the engineer and another parcel of &rsquo;em cut
loose that hind car. <i>Crash</i> it went back&rsquo;ards
down that thar grade, jumped the track and
smashed to smithers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Tully,&rdquo; Mary cried, &ldquo;<i>was</i> anyone
killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man shook his head. &ldquo;Nope, the
guard wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t kilt, but them bandits reckoned as
how he was, &rsquo;totherwise they&rsquo;d have plugged
him. He come to, but they&rsquo;d cleared out, the
whule pack of &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;d tuk the ore with
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora, watching the old man&rsquo;s glittering, pale-blue
eyes that were deep-sunken under shaggy
brows, thought that he seemed actually pleased
about it all, nor was she wrong as his next remark
showed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Jerry-kid, that thar holdup smacks o&rsquo;
old times. It was gettin&rsquo; too gol-darned quiet
around these here parts. Needed suthin&rsquo; like
this to sort o&rsquo; liven us up.&rdquo; He ended with a
cackling laugh that made Mary shudder.</p>
<p>When they were again rattling along the
lonely, rutty road which led to Tombstone, the
nearest town of any size, Mary, nestling close
to Jerry, asked, &ldquo;Big Brother, is Dead Horse
Gulch near here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Little Sister, it isn&rsquo;t, and, as for the
bandits, they&rsquo;re over the border in Mexico by
now, I reckon. Don&rsquo;t you go to worrying about
<i>them</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the rumble seat, a glowing-eyed Dora was
saying: &ldquo;Dick Farley, <i>what</i> if this should be
the <i>same</i> robber gang&mdash;oh, I&rsquo;m trying to say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get you!&rdquo; Dick put in. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wondering
if the three bandits who held up the stage
and may have kidnapped Little Bodil are <i>in</i>
this gang. I doubt it. They&rsquo;d be <i>old</i> fellows by
now. It takes young blood to do deeds of
daring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora&rsquo;s eyes were still glowing. &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; she
said prophetically, &ldquo;I have a hunch that <i>this</i>
robbery is going to do a lot to help us solve the
mystery about Little Bodil. I <i>may</i> be wrong,
but, <i>you</i> may be surprised.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><br />CHAPTER XXII
<br />AN INTERESTING ARRIVAL</h2>
<p>The road to Tombstone was narrow, rutty
and lonesome. Every now and then it dipped
down into a gravelly wash, arroyos in the making,
that were, year after year, being deepened
by the torrents that rushed down the not-distant
mountain sides after a cloudburst. Along
the banks of these dry creek-beds grew low cottonwood
trees, making shelters behind which
bandits <i>might</i> lurk if they were so inclined. But
the girls, having been assured by Jerry that
the train robbers had long since crossed the
Mexican border, were not really fearful. For
once, even Mary was not using her imagination
to a frightening extent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big Brother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I was just thinking
about that aviator friend of Patsy&rsquo;s. Don&rsquo;t
you think it must be wonderful to be flying at
night up under those lovely white stars? They
look so close to the earth here in Arizona as
though Harry Hulbert might almost have to
weave his way among them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>Jerry, evidently more desirous of talking of
stars than of the aviator of the &ldquo;Seagull,&rdquo;
stated matter-of-factly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the clear air here
that makes the stars look so large and close&mdash;sort
of like lanterns hung in a blue-black roof
over our heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a huge star shot across the heavens
leaving a trail of fire. Mary whirled to call
back, &ldquo;Oh, Dora, did you wish on that shooting
star?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope! Didn&rsquo;t see it!&rdquo; was the laconic reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; Jerry asked in a low voice. How
he hoped Mary had echoed <i>his</i> wish, but what
she said was, &ldquo;Yes, I hoped the Seagull would
make a safe landing. It must be terribly dangerous
landing among so many mountain peaks,
or, one might even be forced down in the middle
of a barren stretch of desert, oh, miles from
water or anyone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Jerry were disappointed, he made no comment.
Dora leaned forward to call, &ldquo;From the
top of the next little hill we&rsquo;d ought to be able
to see the lights of Tombstone, hadn&rsquo;t we,
Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we will, lest be the power plant&rsquo;s
out of commission.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>The rather feeble lights of the rattly old car
did little to illumine the well of darkness in
which they were riding. The wash they were
crossing was wide and deep and the girls were
both glad when they climbed that last little hill
and were nearer the stars again. From the top,
they could see the black wall of mountains to
the distant right of them, which Jerry had
called &ldquo;The Dragoons.&rdquo; A desert valley at its
foot stretched away for many miles shimmering
in the starlight. Not far ahead of them was a
cluster of sand hills&mdash;&ldquo;the silver hills&rdquo;&mdash;on
which stood the small mining-town of Tombstone.
The power plant was in order, as was
evidenced by the twinkling of lights. A friendly
group of them marked the main street, and
scattered lights, farther and farther apart, were
shining from the windows of homes. Down the
little hill the car dropped, then began the last
long climb up to the town.</p>
<p>On the main street there were unshaven,
roughly dressed men, some from the range,
others from the mines, loitering about in front
of a lighted pool hall. They were talking, some
of them excitedly, about the recent train robbery.
Jerry drew his car to the curb and leaped
out. Three young cowboys called a greeting to
him. He replied in a friendly way, but turned
at once to assist Mary. Dick and Dora followed
the other two into a low adobe building labeled
&ldquo;Post Office.&rdquo; A light was burning in a small
back room. Jerry opened the door and entered.
A middle-aged man, whose gauntness suggested
that he had come there to be cured of the
&ldquo;white plague,&rdquo; smiled affably. &ldquo;Evening,
Jerry-boy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Wait till I get this message.
The wires are keeping hot tonight along
of that train robbery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>The uneven clicking of the instrument ended;
the man scribbled a few words, called a lounging
boy from a dark corner and dispatched him
to Sheriff Goode. Jerry introduced his companions
to Mr. Hale, then explained the object
of their visit.</p>
<p>Mr. Hale shook his head. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s just
too bad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I happen to know that Gray
Bluffs country well. Stopped off when I first
came West, health-hunting, but it didn&rsquo;t agree
with me there; nothing like this Tombstone
shine and air to make sick lungs well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tanned face and bright eyes told his enthusiasm,
but he added quickly, &ldquo;<i>That</i> won&rsquo;t
interest you any. What I started to say is that
Gray Bluffs isn&rsquo;t a real town, that is not <i>now</i>.
It was, of course, when they first found gold in
the bluffs, but it petered out, the post office
moved to another place and so did the folks
who&rsquo;d lived there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear of a woman named
Burger over there?&rdquo; Jerry asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! That was the name of the postmistress,
Miss Kate Burger. She died, though,
along about five years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the instrument began an excited
clicking. The operator turned his attention to
it. &ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; he ejaculated as though
addressing whoever was sending the message.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Hale, <i>have</i> they caught the robbers?&rdquo;
Mary asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not that.&rdquo; The man was scribbling
rapidly. &ldquo;Say, hasn&rsquo;t that kid&mdash;oh, here you
are, Trombone. Take this back to the Deputy
Sheriff&rsquo;s office. Dep&rsquo;s been loco all day.&rdquo; Then
to the interested listeners, he explained, &ldquo;He&rsquo;d
been promised the help of an air scout from the
East; thought maybe he&rsquo;d had a smashup; was
due this morning early. Well, that last message
was from the head office of the border patrol.
The air scout will be along any time now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Hale, is his name Harry Hulbert?&rdquo;
Mary, her pretty cheeks flushed, listened
eagerly for the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know! Haven&rsquo;t heard! Say, Jerry.&rdquo;
The man looked up quickly, and Dora thought
she&rsquo;d never seen such keen, eagle-like eyes.
&ldquo;You boys had better drop out the back way
if you can. Dep Goode is rounding up all the
able-bodied fellows he can find for the next
posse that&rsquo;s to start as soon as this air pilot
does a little scouting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary, suddenly panicky at the idea, caught
the cowboy&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Oh, Big Brother,&rdquo; she
cried, forgetting that the name would sound
strange to a man who knew that Jerry had no
sisters, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t we get away somehow before
we&rsquo;re seen?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Jerry looked at her tenderly, but shook his
head. &ldquo;No, I cain&rsquo;t dodge my duty. I <i>must</i> volunteer!&rdquo;
Then, to the other boy, &ldquo;Dick, you
drive the girls back to Gleeson, will you? I
reckon the Deputy Sheriff&rsquo;ll let you off. He
isn&rsquo;t after tenderfoot help, meaning no harm,
they&rsquo;d be more of a hindrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick flushed, but knowing that Jerry always
meant whatever he said in the kindest way, he
expressed his disappointment. &ldquo;Oh, I say,
Jerry, can&rsquo;t I come back after I&rsquo;ve taken the
girls home? I&rsquo;d like awfully well to hang around
and watch what happens. I&rsquo;ll promise not to get
underfoot or be in the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Jerry could reply, Mary caught his
coat sleeve and exclaimed, her eyes like stars,
&ldquo;Hark, don&rsquo;t you hear an airplane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all listened and heard distinctly from
above the hum of a motor. Dick sprang toward
the door. &ldquo;Come on, everyone, let&rsquo;s be among
those present on the reception committee,&rdquo; he
said. Then, remembering his manners, he
stepped back and held the door open for the
girls to pass out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, Mr. Hale, and thanks a lot,&rdquo;
Mary called with her sweetest smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;ll all drop in again.&rdquo; The man
had only time to nod before his attention was
again called to the busy little instrument.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>Out in the street, there were many more men.
As the news of the robbery had spread by
horseback riders and remote ranch telephones,
men had galloped into town eager to offer their
services. Now they all stood or sat their horses,
silent, for the most part, as they watched the
great silver bird which was slowly circling
round and round over their heads.</p>
<p>The moon had risen above distant peaks and
was high enough to make the street dimly
lighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it <i>must</i> be Harry!&rdquo; Mary whispered
excitedly as she clutched Jerry&rsquo;s arm not knowing
that she did so. &ldquo;That plane <i>is</i> as silvery as
a seagull, just as Patsy and Polly wrote us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder why he doesn&rsquo;t land,&rdquo; Dick commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon there isn&rsquo;t but one safe landing
place in this town, and that&rsquo;s right here where
the crowd is standing. This square, out front
of the post office, has been landed on before
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See! Something&rsquo;s falling from the plane.&rdquo;
Dora pointed upward. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a small something!
What <i>can</i> it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The object fell like a plummet and landed at
their feet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an aluminum bottle. Oh, look!
There&rsquo;s a note attached to it.&rdquo; Dora picked it
up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes Deputy Sheriff Goode,&rdquo; Jerry
told the others. &ldquo;Give it to me! I&rsquo;ll hand it to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Deputy Sheriff&rsquo;s restless horse did not
stop prancing while the man opened and read
the note. Then he flung it to the ground, pocketing
the small bottle.</p>
<p>Dick, feeling sure that the message had not
been of a private nature, picked it up and with
the aid of his flash he read: &ldquo;Whirl a lantern,
will you, where I&rsquo;m supposed to land. A. S.
H. H.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A. S. means air scout, of course,&rdquo; Dick said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And H. H. is Harry Hulbert. Oh, Dora,
think of our meeting Patsy&rsquo;s aviator.&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s
eyes were shining with excitement.</p>
<p>Jerry could not help hearing Dora&rsquo;s reply.
&ldquo;<i>Not</i> Patsy&rsquo;s!&rdquo; was said teasingly. &ldquo;Remember
<i>this</i> young hero was chosen for <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, silly!&rdquo; Mary retorted, but her rebuke
did not seem to be voicing displeasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Move back! Move back everyone! Scuttle!
Five seconds to clear this square!&rdquo; Cowmen on
horseback were acting as mounted police and
were so effective that in short order the big
square was vacant and ready for the landing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><br />CHAPTER XXIII
<br />A SILVER PLANE</h2>
<p>There was an almost breathless silence for
a moment as the small silver plane swooped
gracefully down and made an easy landing;
then the enthusiasm of the crowd burst forth
in shouts of welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Kid, <i>you&rsquo;re</i> all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of a cayuse to be riding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A silver airship for the silver city!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for the skidder of the skies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horses on the outskirts of the crowd, unused
to such commotion, reared and pranced on their
hind legs. Then, seeming to believe that something
<i>might</i> be lacking in the warmth of their
welcome, a cowboy shot off his gun into the air.
Instantly Deputy Sheriff Goode shouted for
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nixy on that!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;All of you
fellows get to shootin&rsquo; an&rsquo; we won&rsquo;t do much
creepin&rsquo; up on the gang.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; Mary said to Jerry. &ldquo;He must
think those bandits are hiding somewhere <i>near
here</i>. They couldn&rsquo;t possibly hear the shooting
if they were over the border in Mexico, could
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cowboy shook his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that
he doesn&rsquo;t want to take any chances, I reckon.&rdquo;
Then, generously, he added, &ldquo;You girls will
want to meet Harry Hulbert, won&rsquo;t you? He&rsquo;s
talking to the &lsquo;Dep&rsquo; now. Jehoshaphat! That&rsquo;s
too bad. He&rsquo;s going right up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the Deputy Sheriff wants Harry to
start in scouting and not waste time visiting
with girls,&rdquo; Dora remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back! Back everyone!&rdquo; the deputized cowboys
rode around the square, clearing it again,
for the curious and interested crowd had
pressed close to the plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, up she goes! Whoopee!&rdquo; Some
cowboy shouted in Mary&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Me for the
air!&rdquo; he waved his sombrero so close that it
fanned her cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that the plumb-beatenest way to go
places?&rdquo; another cowboy was actually addressing
Dora in such a friendly manner that she
replied in like spirit, &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s great!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry turned to Dick. &ldquo;Take the girls back
to where we left the car, will you? I&rsquo;m going
to speak to Goode. Be over in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Big Brother,&rdquo; Mary caught his hand,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t do anything that <i>might</i> be dangerous,
will you? It would be terrible for your mother
if anything happened to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>Hope and love had, for a moment, lighted the
cowboy&rsquo;s eyes, but the last part of Mary&rsquo;s importuning
had seemed to be entirely for another,
and so, as he turned away, Jerry&rsquo;s heart
was heavy.</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s gaze, he noticed, had quickly turned
from him up to the sky where a silver plane
was still discernible riding toward the moon.</p>
<p>Dick took an arm of each girl and the crowd
made a path for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like these cowmen and boys, don&rsquo;t you,
Dora?&rdquo; Mary had climbed into the rumble with
her friend. &ldquo;They have such nice, kind faces
and they&rsquo;re so picturesque with their wide hats
and colored shirts and handkerchiefs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora nodded. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a boy over there on
horseback. See his leather chaps are fringed
and he has spurs on his boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They act as though this was some sort of
a celebration, don&rsquo;t they, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy was leaning against the car watching
the milling throng which was being augmented
in numbers by newcomers riding in
from the dark desert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the big show?&rdquo; A weazened,
grizzly-headed man in tattered clothes had suddenly
appeared at Dick&rsquo;s side. He had a canvas-covered
roll strapped to his back and carried
a stout stick. His pinched face was
starved-looking and his eyes were feverishly
bright.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>Dick explained what was happening and,
without a word, the queer creature scuttled out
of sight in the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That poor man!&rdquo; Mary exclaimed sympathetically.
&ldquo;What <i>can</i> he be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; Dick replied. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
been out here long enough to know all the
types.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pleasant voice said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a typical
desert rat. He digs around and sometimes finds
a little gold, but mostly he lives on sand, I
reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary recognized the speaker as a clerk in the
grocery store. Before she could ask more about
the poor unfortunate, someone hailed their informant
and he hurried away.</p>
<p>Jerry returned and his face was grave. &ldquo;I
hardly know what to say,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to frighten you girls unnecessarily, but
Deputy Sheriff Goode thinks it would be unwise
for you to return over that lonely road to Gleeson
tonight, or, at least not until the hiding
place of the bandits has been discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jerry!&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s one thought was concern
for her father. &ldquo;I <i>must</i> let Dad know that
I am safe and that I may not be home at once.
Won&rsquo;t you please telephone him? You will know
best what to say.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll be back in a minute.&rdquo; They
watched him pushing his way toward the one
drug store in the town.</p>
<p>Mary turned toward Dick. &ldquo;Now, what does
<i>that</i> mean, do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it merely means that the &lsquo;Dep&rsquo;
isn&rsquo;t sure that the robbers <i>did</i> cross into Mexico.
He thinks they may be hiding nearer here
than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought as much,&rdquo; Dora commented,
&ldquo;when he was so upset because a cowboy
started shooting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry was not gone long. &ldquo;I explained to
your mother, Dick. She said Mr. Moore is
asleep and that she will not waken him. Her
advice is that you girls take a room in the little
old hotel here and wait until morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were relieved as they had neither
of them relished the idea of returning over that
desolately lonesome road with bandits at large.</p>
<p>Jerry was continuing. &ldquo;Mrs. Goode runs the
hotel and she&rsquo;s just as nice and friendly as she
can be. The mothering sort. Dick, you stay
here in the car, will you, while I escort the girls
across the road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the greatest of pleasure!&rdquo; the Eastern
boy said.</p>
<p>Dora teased, as she permitted him to assist
her out of the rumble. &ldquo;You ought <i>not</i> to say
that you&rsquo;re pleased to have us <i>leave</i> you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not <i>that</i>; <span class="small">NEVER</span>!&rdquo; Dick assured her, then
in a low voice he confided, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wild to
be <i>in</i> on all this, and if I&rsquo;d been sent home with
you girls, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora laughingly interrupted. &ldquo;You might
have been <i>in</i> it more than any of the others.&rdquo;
She shuddered at the thought. &ldquo;We three might
have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Now</i>, who&rsquo;s using her imagination?&rdquo; Mary
inquired. Then, after scanning the heavens, she
added, &ldquo;Big Brother, the Seagull has flown entirely
out of sight, hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it has. Back in a minute, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary and Dora were thrilled with excitement
and thought all that was transpiring a high
adventure, although they <i>were</i> a little troubled,
fearing that the three boys in whom they were
interested might be in danger before the night
was over.</p>
<p>The old adobe two-story building to which
Jerry led the girls was across the wide square
from the post office. The large office was filled
with people, most of them women of the town
who had gathered there. Many had come from
the lonely outskirts. They had been afraid to
stay alone in their homes while their men were
bandit-hunting.</p>
<p>Jerry soon saw the pleasant face of the
rather short, plump Mrs. Goode. He led the
girls to her and explained their presence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So <i>you</i> are Mary Moore grown up!&rdquo; the
woman said kindly. &ldquo;I knew your mother well
when she came here as a bride. Everyone loved
her in these parts; they sure did.&rdquo; Then, to
the tall cowboy who stood waiting, although
impatient to be away, she assured him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
take good care of them, don&rsquo;t fear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you will. Good night, Mary and
Dora.&rdquo; The cowboy held out a hand to each
then was gone.</p>
<p>Dora thought, &ldquo;Oho, <i>something has</i> happened.
There was no tenderness in <i>that</i> parting.
Hum-m, what can it be? Ah, I believe I
see light!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary was saying, &ldquo;I do hope that Harry
Hulbert is all right. Isn&rsquo;t it the most heroic
thing that he is doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he, dearie?&rdquo; Mrs. Goode, having
heard, asked. &ldquo;Oh, yes, the sky pilot. A nice
face he has. I gave him a cup of coffee. His
manners are the best ever. Well, come along
upstairs. I&rsquo;ll give you the front corner room
where you can watch the goings-on, if you&rsquo;d
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, please do, Mrs. Goode. I never was
more thrilled in all my days.&rdquo; It was Dora
speaking. &ldquo;I know that I won&rsquo;t sleep a single
mite, will you, Mary?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to try,&rdquo; that fair maid replied
as they followed up the broad carpeted
stairway and entered a plainly furnished hotel
room. There were two large windows overlooking
the square below and the girls, having said
good night to their hostess, went at once to
look down upon the crowd.</p>
<p>The men had divided into small groups and
were talking earnestly together. A group of
younger cowboys just in front of the hotel,
were making merry. One of them strummed a
guitar and several of them flung themselves
about dancing wildly, improvising as they
went along. Their efforts were applauded
hilariously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one would guess that they thought they
<i>might</i> be going to battle with bandits before
morning,&rdquo; Mary said. Then she looked up at
the moon-shimmered sky. For a long time she
gazed intently at one spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a pale star or is it the little silver
plane coming nearer?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Dora watched the faintly glittering object,
then exclaimed glowingly, &ldquo;It surely <i>is</i> the Seagull.
Oh, Mary, <i>do</i> you suppose Harry Hulbert
has located those bandits?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><br />CHAPTER XXIV
<br />A LONG NIGHT WATCH</h2>
<p>Someone in the crowd saw the approaching
plane. A shout went up which was augmented
to a roar of welcome. Once again a
space was cleared; this time without the command
from the Deputy Sheriff.</p>
<p>The girls threw open the window and leaned
out as the plane landed and the men closed in
about it. How they wished they could hear what
was being said. They saw Harry Hulbert leap
out and, by his excited gestures, the girls were
sure that he had made some discovery which
he considered important.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to be pointing toward &lsquo;The
Dragoons.&rsquo;&rdquo; Mary looked over the scattered
buildings of the town, across the gray desert
to the dull red cliffs that loomed dark in the
moonlight.</p>
<p>Dora caught her friend&rsquo;s arm and held it
tight. &ldquo;Mary Moore,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;if we had
gone home tonight, we would have passed the
side road that leads to &lsquo;The Dragoons,&rsquo;
wouldn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>Mary nodded, but said nothing. She knew
what her friend was thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch what they&rsquo;re doing now. The sheriff
is having the men who are armed show their
guns. Here come boys from the jail bringing
more firearms.&rdquo; Mary turned a face, white with
alarm. &ldquo;Oh, Dora, don&rsquo;t you wish this was all
over? Look, Jerry and Dick and Harry are
getting up on horseback. I do hope Harry
knows how to ride. Good gracious, Dora, those
three boys are going with the sheriff to lead
the posse. Isn&rsquo;t that terrible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as it is,&rdquo; was the surprisingly
calm reply. &ldquo;Naturally Harry would be the one
to lead the men to the place where he saw the
bandits hiding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Women in the office of the hotel, seeing that
their men were about to ride away, rushed out
to bid them goodbye.</p>
<p>The young boys and old men were not taken.
After the others were gone, there was an almost
deathlike stillness down in the square. The
women returned indoors. Old men, many of
them gray-bearded, stood in groups on the sidewalks
talking in low tones and shaking their
grizzled heads ominously. The boys trooped
over to the pool hall. The proprietor had been
among the men who had ridden away and so
the boys could play without charge which they
did gleefully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>Mary sank down on a low rocker near the
window and her sweet blue eyes were tragic as
she gazed up at her friend. &ldquo;Dora,&rdquo; she said
&ldquo;if you were a boy, would you have dared to
ride into a robber&rsquo;s den the way&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; was the brief reply. Dora still
stood gazing at the desert valley. Although the
road disappeared from their sight when it first
dipped down from the town, she knew that the
riders would again be visible as they crossed
to &ldquo;The Dragoons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can see them crossing the valley, so
can the bandits,&rdquo; she said, thinking aloud. &ldquo;Of
course, the robbers must have look-outs if
that&rsquo;s what men are called who spy around to
warn the others of danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they are! There they are!&rdquo; Mary
leaped to her feet to point. Dark distant objects
were moving rapidly across the moonlit
sands of the valley.</p>
<p>Suddenly Mary turned, a new alarm expressed
in her face. &ldquo;Dora,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;now
that only old men and boys are left here to protect
this town, what if the bandits should circle
around and rob the stores and the post office&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And carry off the beautiful young damsels,&rdquo;
Dora laughingly added, &ldquo;like a chapter out of
an old-time story-book.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It may be amusing to you,&rdquo; Mary seemed
actually hurt, &ldquo;but things <i>do</i> happen even <i>now</i>
that are worse than anything I ever read in a
book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto! Ah agrees, as Sambo says.&rdquo; Dora
turned and slipped an arm about her friend,
and then, as though trying to change her
thought, she went on, &ldquo;I wonder if that old
darky and Marthy, his wife, will be working at
Sunnybank Seminary next fall when we go
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That all seems so far away and so long
ago, almost like a dream,&rdquo; Mary replied, as she
gazed down at the silver plane which had been
left in the care of the old men. They were walking
around it now, looking it over with frank
curiosity.</p>
<p>Dora tried again. &ldquo;How I do wish Patsy
and Polly were here! Pat, especially, would get
a great &lsquo;kick,&rsquo; as she&rsquo;d call it, out of all this
excitement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than I am, no doubt,&rdquo; Mary confessed.
&ldquo;My imagination is getting wilder and
wilder every minute. I&rsquo;m expecting something
awful to happen right here and&mdash;what was
that?&rdquo; She jumped and put her hand on her
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone knocked on the door.&rdquo; Dora went
to open it. Mrs. Goode, looking anxious in spite
of her smile, said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you girls want something
to eat? It&rsquo;s almost midnight and you must
be hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, Mrs. Goode, I suppose we
are hungry. We&rsquo;re so terribly nervous, I don&rsquo;t
know as we could eat, really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, try, dearies. Here&rsquo;s Washita with a
tray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Washita was an Indian girl with black, furtive
eyes and a red woolen dress. She also had
red rags twined in with her long black braids.
She carried a tray into the room. Silently, she
placed it on a table and glided out. Mary shuddered
unconsciously. &ldquo;Indians give me the
&lsquo;shilly-shivers&rsquo; as Pat says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Washita is harmless. I&rsquo;ve had her for two
years now. She&rsquo;s almost the last of a powerful
tribe of Apaches which, long ago, had &lsquo;The
Dragoons&rsquo; for their fortress,&rdquo; Mrs. Goode was
explaining, when Mary begged, &ldquo;Oh, do tell us
what you think the outcome of this raid will be.
You know we have three dear friends in the
posse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora thought, &ldquo;Aha! Harry Hulbert is a
dear friend, is he, even before we have met
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Goode was replying. &ldquo;I have a husband
and two dearly loved sons among those men,
but, they <i>must</i> do their duty. The life of a
sheriff&rsquo;s wife is one of constant fear. I am
feeling sure, though, that they will all come
back soon with their captives. The jail is ready
for the bandits. Now I must go back to the
office. If you want me, ring the bell. I&rsquo;ll send
Washita up for the tray&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Goode, please don&rsquo;t! Somehow she
startles me.&rdquo; It was Mary imploring, although
she knew her fears were foolish.</p>
<p>Mrs. Goode merely replied, &ldquo;All right, dear.
The tray can wait until morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora moved the kerosene lamp from the
bureau to the small table. Then they sat down
and nibbled at the chicken sandwiches which
had been temptingly made. The milk was
creamy and Dora succeeded in finishing her
share.</p>
<p>Mary, carrying a half-eaten sandwich, went
to the window and looked across the desert.
She whirled and beckoned, then pointed.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see a horseman galloping this
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do see some object that seems to be coming
pretty fast,&rdquo; Dora conceded. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s
out of sight below the silver hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost breathless they waited until the
horseman again appeared. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably the
bearer of some sort of message,&rdquo; Dora decided
when the man leaped from his horse and ran
into the hotel.</p>
<p>Mary had put the partly eaten sandwich back
on her plate and sat with clenched hands waiting&mdash;hoping
that they would soon learn the
news which the man brought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t expect the worst,&rdquo; Dora begged.</p>
<p>Although Mary was hoping there would come
a knock at their door, she jumped again when
she heard it. Once more it was Dora who went
to admit their caller. A young cowboy, hot
and panting, stood there holding out an envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The writin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t in it, it&rsquo;s on the back
of it,&rdquo; he informed them.</p>
<p>It had evidently been an old letter Dick had
found in his pocket as it bore his name on the
envelope. The scribbled note was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all right. The worst is over. Surprised
the men while they were all drunk except
the sentinels. We&rsquo;re fetching them in. Be
back by daybreak. Better get some sleep now.&rdquo;
Dick&rsquo;s name was signed to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks be.&rdquo; Mary finished her sandwich
when the cowboy was gone, while Dora, who
was turning back the bedspread, said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
take Dick&rsquo;s advice and go to sleep or at least
try to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll lie down,&rdquo; Mary was removing
her shoes as she spoke, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t expect to
sleep a wink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They removed their outer clothing, then drew
a quilt up over them. The boys from the pool
room had crossed to hear the news and many
of them returned to their homes with their
mothers. They evidently believed implicitly
that all of the bandits had been captured and
so they had nothing to fear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>The humming of voices in the office was
stilled and soon there were no sounds in the
street below.</p>
<p>Dora, no longer anxious, went to sleep
quickly and although Mary had been sure she
wouldn&rsquo;t sleep at all, at daybreak they neither
of them heard the men returning. It was hours
later when there came a rap on their door.
Mary sat up looking about wildly. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
there?&rdquo; she called, almost fearfully, then remembering
that all was well, she jumped up
and opened the door a crack. Mrs. Goode
smiled in at her. &ldquo;Dearie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Jerry
sent me up to ask if you girls will come down
to breakfast now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we will. Thanks a lot.&rdquo; Still Dora
slept on. Mary shook her laughingly as she
said, &ldquo;Wake up, Dodo! The hour is here at
last when we are to meet Pat&rsquo;s aviator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora sprang out of bed and hurriedly
dressed. &ldquo;I feel in my bones,&rdquo; she prophesied,
&ldquo;that you and I will <i>share</i> in some excitement
today. See if we don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><br />CHAPTER XXV
<br />A CRY FOR HELP</h2>
<p>The three boys glanced toward the stairway
as the girls descended. Dick advanced to
meet them, then introduced the tall, lithe young
stranger as the &ldquo;hero of the hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry Hulbert&rsquo;s rather greenish-blue eyes
had a humorous twinkle which softened their
keenness. He looked down at the girls with
sincere pleasure in his rather thin face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is great!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard
so much about you from your friends Patsy
and Polly that I feel well acquainted with both
Miss Moore and Miss Bellman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t &lsquo;Miss&rsquo; us, <i>please</i>!&rdquo; Dora begged.
&ldquo;It makes me feel old as the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I won&rsquo;t until I&rsquo;m far away,&rdquo; he replied
gallantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really awfully glad to be
able to say Mary and Dora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry&rsquo;s glance at the fairer, younger girl
was undeniably admiring and Dora thought,
&ldquo;I wonder if <i>he knows</i> that Pat has given him
to Mary. Poor Jerry, he looks sort of miserable.&rdquo;
Aloud Dora exclaimed, &ldquo;Dick, do lead
us to the dining-room. I&rsquo;m famished.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>The cafe was in a low, adjoining building.
There had been no pretense at beautifying the
place. It was plain and bare but clean and
sun-flooded.</p>
<p>It was late and whoever may have breakfasted
there had long since gone so the young
people had the place to themselves. They chose
a table for six though there were but five of
them. Harry was at one end with Mary at his
right. He had led her to that place without
question. Dick escorted Dora to the opposite
end and sat beside her. Jerry took the seat
across from Mary, at Harry&rsquo;s left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a trump!&rdquo; Dora thought as she noted
how unselfishly Jerry played the gracious host.</p>
<p>Mrs. Goode took their order, and Washita
silently, and, with what to Mary seemed like
stealthy movements, served it.</p>
<p>While they were eating, the curious girls
begged to hear all that had happened, but Dick
said, &ldquo;Why drag it out? Harry saw and we all
conquered. Not a gun was fired, not a drop of
blood was spilled. The bags of ore were discovered
and are now locked up in the cellar of
the jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jerry,&rdquo; Mary exclaimed instinctively
turning to her older acquaintance, &ldquo;how can
you be sure that the bandits were <i>all</i> captured?
Couldn&rsquo;t one or two of them have been
away scouting or something?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That we can&rsquo;t tell for sure, of course, but
I reckon we got them all.&rdquo; Then turning to
Dick, he added, &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better be getting back
to <i>Bar N</i> soon as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary, flushed and shining-eyed, leaned
toward the young aviator. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to
fly over to Gleeson, aren&rsquo;t you, so that we may
get really acquainted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to, awfully well, but Jerry tells
me that there isn&rsquo;t a safe landing anywhere
for miles around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha,&rdquo; Dora thought, &ldquo;Jerry scores there.&rdquo;
But she was wrong, for the cowboy was saying
generously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Deputy Sheriff Goode
will loan you a car. He has two little ones besides
the town ambulance. I&rsquo;d ask you to ride
with us but my rattletrap will only hold four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s suggestion was carried out. Deputy
Sheriff Goode had a small car he was glad to
loan to Harry. The proprietor of the pool hall
agreed to watch the &ldquo;Seagull&rdquo; and warn all
curious boys to stay away from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be able to stay long,&rdquo; Harry told
them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to fly back to headquarters
in Tucson this afternoon to report.&rdquo; Then,
glancing at Mary, invitation in his eyes, he
asked, &ldquo;Must I ride all alone in this borrowed
flivver?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not! I&rsquo;ll ride with you if the
others are willing. I mean,&rdquo; Mary actually
blushed in her confusion, &ldquo;if you would like
to have me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer Harry took her arm and led her
across to the small car which stood waiting in
front of the hotel. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll follow where you
lead, Jerry,&rdquo; he called to the cowboy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since Dora was already in the rumble, Dick
climbed in beside her and Jerry started his
small car and turned toward the valley road.
Dora said not one word but the glance her dark
eyes gave her companion spoke volumes. His
equally silent reply was understanding and eloquent.</p>
<p>Harry had a moment&rsquo;s difficulty in starting
his borrowed car and they did not overtake
the others until they were out of the town and
about to dip down into the desert valley. Then,
when Jerry&rsquo;s car was not far ahead, the young
aviator slowed down and smiled at Mary in the
friendliest way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this is actually <i>you</i>,&rdquo; he said. His tone
inferred that it was hard to believe. &ldquo;Pat had
a picture of you in a fluffy white dress. That
photographer was an artist all right. He caught
the sunlight on your hair so that, to <i>me</i>, you
looked, honestly, just like an angel from heaven
come down. I thought the girl who had posed
for <i>that</i> picture must be the earth&rsquo;s sweetest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>Wild roses could not have been pinker than
Mary&rsquo;s cheeks. She protested, &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t
flatter me that way. I <i>might</i> believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather hoped you <i>would</i> believe it,&rdquo; the
boy said earnestly, then abruptly he changed
the subject. &ldquo;This is a great country, isn&rsquo;t it?
And to think that <i>you</i> were born here. It&rsquo;s all
so rough and rugged, it&rsquo;s hard to picture a frail
flower&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary laughingly interrupted. &ldquo;You should
see the exquisite blossoms that grow on a
thorny cactus plant,&rdquo; she told him. Then, seeing
that Jerry had stopped his car and was
waiting for them to come alongside, she exclaimed,
&ldquo;I wonder what Big Brother wants.
We&rsquo;re close to the side road, aren&rsquo;t we, where
you turned last night when you went over to
&lsquo;The Dragoons?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe we are,&rdquo; Harry replied absently,
then asked, &ldquo;Why do you call Jerry Newcomb
&lsquo;Big Brother?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, because we were playmates years ago
when we were small and I&rsquo;ve always called
his mother &lsquo;Aunt Mollie.&rsquo; He takes good care
of me just like a real brother,&rdquo; she ended
rather lamely.</p>
<p>Harry was bringing his small car to a standstill
near the other. He leaned close to Mary
and said in a low voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s <i>only</i>
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>Although the occupants of the other car could
not hear the words, they had seen the almost
affectionate way in which the words had been
spoken.</p>
<p>Dora thought, &ldquo;Aviators are evidently lightning
workers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s expression did not reveal his
thoughts. He spoke to both Dick and Harry.
&ldquo;I did something last night, I reckon, I <i>never</i>
did before. I laid my six shooter down on a
rock and in all the excitement I plumb forgot
it. Would you mind if we went up this road
a piece&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jerry,&rdquo; Dora cried, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t we go with
you all the way and see where you found the
bandits?&rdquo; Then, as the cowboy hesitated, Dick
said, &ldquo;I think it would be perfectly <i>safe</i> to go,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon so.&rdquo; Jerry was about to start his
car when Mary called, &ldquo;Jerry Newcomb, I
never once thought to ask you or Dick if there
were any <i>old</i> men among those bandits, I mean,
any who <i>might</i> have been the ones who held up
the stage and kidnapped Little Bodil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry replied, &ldquo;I reckon not. They were too
young.&rdquo; Then he turned his car into the side
road.</p>
<p>Harry, following, exclaimed, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this
about a kidnapping? It sounds interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>Mary was glad to have something to talk
about which could not possibly suggest a compliment
to her. She found it embarrassing to
be so much admired by a boy who was almost
a stranger to her. She told the story briefly,
but from the beginning, and Harry was an appreciative
listener. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bang-up good
mystery yarn!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like mighty well
to be along when Jerry and Dick climb up into
that rock house. Gruesome, isn&rsquo;t it, knowing
that the old duffer buried himself alive? Clever,
that&rsquo;s what he was, to make up a yarn about
an Evil Eye Turquoise that would keep thieves
all these years away from his gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The side road into the mountains was in
worse condition than the one they had left, and
so, for some moments, Harry was silent that he
might give all his attention to guiding the car
over an especially dangerous spot. Then he
turned and smiled at Mary. &ldquo;And so <i>you</i> had
hoped that one of those bandits who were captured
last night <i>might</i> have been Bodil&rsquo;s kidnapper.
That would hardly be possible. Such
things don&rsquo;t happen in real life and, also, as
you say, the little girl may have been dragged
away to the lair of a mountain lion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s attention had been attracted by the
car ahead. &ldquo;Jerry&rsquo;s stopping again,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Harry put on the brakes. The cowboy had
leaped out and was coming back toward them.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;d better try to go any further
along this road,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;Harry,
if you will stay with the girls, Dick and I
will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hark, Big Brother, <i>what</i> was that?&rdquo; Mary
held up a finger and listened intently. On their
left was a deep brush-tangled arroyo. They
all heard distinctly a low moan that seemed
to form the word &ldquo;Help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys looked at each other puzzled and
wondering. Jerry&rsquo;s hand slipped instinctively
to his holster and, finding it empty, he held out
his hand for Dick&rsquo;s gun. Then he went cautiously
to the rock-piled edge of the arroyo.
Dora asked, &ldquo;Does Jerry think it&rsquo;s one of the
bandits, do you suppose, who tried to get away
and was hurt somehow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; Dick replied. He leaped out to
the road and Harry joined him. They watched
Jerry&rsquo;s every move, ready to go to him if he
beckoned. Suddenly Mary screamed and Harry
leaped back to her. They had heard the report
of a gun although Jerry had not fired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<h2 id="c26"><br />CHAPTER XXVI
<br />IS IT A CLUE?</h2>
<p>The shot undeniably had been fired from
the brush-tangled arroyo. Jerry stepped back
that he might not be a helpless target while
he conferred with the other boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cain&rsquo;t understand it at all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If
we missed getting one of the bandits, he
wouldn&rsquo;t be staying around here. By this time,
he&rsquo;d be miles away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right about that,&rdquo; Dick agreed.
&ldquo;My theory is that the man who called for help
was the one who fired the shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that possibly
someone is hurt and fearing that his call wasn&rsquo;t
heard, he fired his gun to attract our attention?
He may have heard our cars climbing the
grade. They made noise enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry, feeling convinced that this was more
than likely a fact, went again to the edge of
the arroyo, and, keeping hidden behind the
jagged pile of rocks, he looked intently through
the dark tangle to the dry creek in the arroyo
bottom. As his eyes became accustomed to the
dimness he saw the figure of an old man lying
on his back, one leg bent under him, his arms
thrown out helplessly. One hand held a gun.
Undeniably he it was who had fired the shot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Without waiting to inform the others of his
decision, Jerry leaped over the rocks and
crashed through the brush. Dick and Harry
followed a second later.</p>
<p>As they stood looking down at the wan face
of a very old man their hearts were touched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor fellow,&rdquo; Jerry said, kneeling and lifting
the hand that held the gun. &ldquo;I reckon firing
that shot was the last act he did in this life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure.&rdquo; Dick had opened the old
man&rsquo;s torn shirt and was listening to his heart.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s still alive. Hadn&rsquo;t we better get him
back to Tombstone to a doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer the boys lifted the stranger who
was lighter than they had dreamed possible and
carried him slowly back up to the road. The
girls, awed and silent, asked if they could help,
but Jerry shook his head. At his suggestion the
old man was placed at his side. The girls rolled
their sweater coats to place under his head and
shoulders. Dick, from the back, through a tear
in the curtain, held him in position.</p>
<p>Turning the cars was difficult but not impossible.
Awed and in silence they returned
to town.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>Dr. Conrad, luckily, was in his office in a
small adobe building near the hotel. The old
man was still breathing when he was carried
in and laid on a couch. Restoratives quickly
applied were effective and soon the tired
sunken eyes opened. The unkempt grizzled head
turned restlessly, then pleadingly he asked,
&ldquo;Jackie, have you seen him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was such a yearning eagerness in the
old man&rsquo;s face that Mary hated to have to
shake her head and say, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry asked, &ldquo;Who is Jackie?&rdquo; But the old
man did not reply. As though the effort had been
too much for him, he closed his eyes and rested.</p>
<p>Dick exclaimed eagerly, &ldquo;Jerry, you know
that young boy we brought over with the bandits.
Couldn&rsquo;t we ask Deputy Sheriff Goode to
bring him over here? He would know if this
old man belongs to the robber band, although
that boy certainly didn&rsquo;t look like a criminal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plan seemed a good one and was carried
out. The boy, fair-haired and about nine years
old, cried out when he saw the old man and
running to him, threw himself down beside the
lounge and sobbed, &ldquo;Granddad! Granddad!
Oh, <i>do</i> wake up. I&rsquo;m so glad you found me.
I thought <i>this</i> time they&rsquo;d make away with me
for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>Slowly a smile spread over the wan features.
The sunken eyes opened and looked directly
at the tear-wet face of the boy. &ldquo;Jackie,&rdquo;
the old man said, and there was infinite love
in his voice. &ldquo;Thank God you&rsquo;re safe! They&rsquo;ve
ruined me. They <i>mustn&rsquo;t</i> ruin you. Go to Sister
Theresa. Hide there.&rdquo; For a long moment
he breathed heavily, his gaze on the face of the
boy he so loved. Then he made another effort to
speak. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying, Jackie. I give you to Sister
Theresa. Goodbye. Be&mdash;a&mdash;good boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls, unable to keep back their tears,
turned away, but Mary, hearing the child&rsquo;s pitiful
sobs, went over to him and, kneeling at his
side, put a comforting arm about him. Trustingly
he leaned his head against her shoulder
and clung to her as though he knew she must
be a friend.</p>
<p>Later, when the boy&rsquo;s grief had been quieted,
the young people, at the doctor&rsquo;s suggestion,
took him into another room and questioned him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How had he happened to be with the robber
band?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was his grandfather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where would they find Sister Theresa that
they might take him there as his granddad had
requested?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Still in the loving shelter of Mary&rsquo;s arm, the
boy, at first chokingly, then more clearly, told
all that he knew. His grandfather, he said, had
been a marked man by that robber band. He
had done something <i>years ago</i> to turn them
against him, Jackie didn&rsquo;t know what. They
had robbed him. They had destroyed his ranch
and his cattle. They had stolen Jackie once
before, but he had gotten away that time, but
this time they had watched him too closely.
Granddad had been hunting for him.</p>
<p>Sister Theresa? She was a nun and lived in a
convent on the Papago reservation up to the
north, quite far to the north, Jackie thought.</p>
<p>Deputy Sheriff Goode came in and listened
to what Jerry had to tell him of the child&rsquo;s
story. He nodded solemnly. &ldquo;I know that good
woman,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;she is one of the world&rsquo;s
best. I reckon the kid&rsquo;s telling the truth. If
you have the time, Jerry, I wish you&rsquo;d take
him over there right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The combination ambulance and police car
was brought out. That it was seldom used was
evidenced by the sand on the seats and floor.
Jerry drove it to a gas station and had the tank
filled. Jackie, who clung to Mary as though she
alone could understand his grief, nestled close
to her in the big car.</p>
<p>Harry said to Jerry, &ldquo;Old man, I think I&rsquo;d
better fly over. The Papago reservation is close
to Tucson, isn&rsquo;t it, and I must turn in a report.
Then I&rsquo;ll join you all and come back with you
perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please do!&rdquo; Mary called to him. &ldquo;I
want you to meet the nicest dad in the world.
He&rsquo;ll be so interested in hearing about your
trip from the East.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>A crowd of townspeople had gathered in the
square and silently watched as the big police car
started and the &ldquo;Seagull&rdquo; took to the air.</p>
<p>As they were rumbling along, Dora, across
from Mary, silently pointed at the boy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
asleep, little dear,&rdquo; she said softly.</p>
<p>Dick was on the driver&rsquo;s seat with Jerry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dora,&rdquo; Mary whispered, &ldquo;how tangled up
things are. We <i>were</i> hunting for one child and
find another. Something seems always to lead
us farther away from solving the mystery of
poor Little Bodil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Dora agreed, &ldquo;but after all, we
could hardly expect, I suppose, after all these
years, to unravel <i>that</i> mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not a long ride. The road was smooth
and hard. The car rolled along so rapidly that
the forty miles were covered in less than an
hour. Dora, looking out of the opening in the
back of the wagon, was delighted when she saw
tepees along the roadside. Also, there were
small adobe shacks with yucca stalk fences and
drying ears of corn and red peppers in strings
hanging over them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how fascinating this place is!&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;Do look! There&rsquo;s a Papago family.
The mother has her baby strapped to her back.&rdquo;
The convent was an unpretentious rambling
adobe building painted a glistening
white. Jerry turned in through an arched
adobe gate over which stood a wooden cross.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>At a side door he stopped, got out and, climbing
a few steps, pulled on a rope which hung
there. Almost at once the door was opened by
a sweet-faced nun who smiled a welcome. Jerry
asked, &ldquo;May we speak with Sister Theresa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, will you come in?&rdquo; Then, glancing out
at the car and seeing the two girls, she added
hospitably, &ldquo;all of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry lifted out the sleeping boy and carried
him into the long, cool waiting room. The sister
who had opened the door had gone to call Sister
Theresa and so she did not see the child.</p>
<p>Mary glanced skyward before she entered
the convent and, seeing the silver plane circling
about, wondered if Harry would be able to land.
Evidently he decided that it would be unwise,
for he was dropping the small aluminum bottle
once again. Mary ran to the spot where it fell
and read the note. &ldquo;Unsafe to land on the
sand. Will return to Tombstone and wait for
you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora glanced at Mary&rsquo;s face and saw an expression
which told her disappointment. Once
again she thought, &ldquo;Poor Jerry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick, who had waited for them, said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
a wise bird, that Harry Hulbert. He takes no
chances.&rdquo; Then they three went indoors and
joined Jerry who, seated on a bench, held the
sleeping child.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<h2 id="c27"><br />CHAPTER XXVII
<br />IT WAS A CLUE</h2>
<p>Jackie wakened and opened wondering
eyes at the moment when a kind-faced woman
in nun&rsquo;s garb entered from an inner corridor.
With a glad cry he slipped from Jerry and ran
with arms outstretched.</p>
<p>The young people rose and waited, sure that
this woman, who had stooped to comfort the
sobbing child, must be the Sister Theresa to
whom he had been given. She was evidently
questioning him and brokenly he was telling
that the robbers had carried him off and that
Granddad was dead.</p>
<p>She lifted a sorrowful face toward the
strange young people and without questioning
their identity, she said, &ldquo;It was very kind of
you all to bring Jackie to me. Did Mr. Weston
send me a message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry, realizing that formal introductions
were unnecessary at a time like this, replied,
&ldquo;Yes, Sister Theresa. The old man was so
nearly dead when we found him in an arroyo
over near &lsquo;The Dragoons&rsquo; that he could say
little. However, he <i>did</i> give Jackie to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The nun had seated herself and had motioned
the others to do likewise. The boy, standing
at her side, was looking up into her face with
tear-filled, anxious eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little fellow,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;His life has
been full of fear, but now, if those tormentors
of his grandfather are in prison, he will be free
of the constant dread of being kidnapped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister Theresa,&rdquo; Mary leaned forward to
ask, &ldquo;<i>why</i> did those cruel men wish to harm
so helpless a child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nun shook her head sadly. &ldquo;It is a long
story,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and one that causes me much
pain to recall, but I will tell you. Years ago
this good man, who had the largest cattle ranch
in these parts, was riding over the mountains
carrying about his person large sums of money.
He was overtaken by two highwaymen, who,
after robbing him, forced him to continue with
them over a lonely mountain road. When they
were at a high spot, they heard a stage coming
and they forced Mr. Weston to hide with them
around a curve. When the stage was almost
upon them, the bandits rode out, shot the driver
and stole the bags of gold they found. The
frightened horses plunged over a cliff taking
with it the dead driver and one man passenger.
A child, that man&rsquo;s sister, was thrown into the
road. The bandits thought only of escape, and,
for a time, they forgot their captive. Seeing
a chance to get away, he turned his horse and
galloped back toward his ranch. Finding the
child in the road, he took time to snatch her up
and take her with him. He brought her to this
convent where she has been ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>The listeners, who, one and all had guessed
the speaker&rsquo;s true identity, could hardly wait
until she had finished to ask if she were the
long lost Little Bodil.</p>
<p>Tense emotion brought tears to the woman&rsquo;s
kind eyes. &ldquo;My dears,&rdquo; she said, looking from
one to another of them. &ldquo;My dears, <i>can</i> you
tell me of my brother, Sven Pedersen? I have
always thought that he must have been killed
when the stage plunged over the cliff. At first
I hoped this was not true, but when he never
came to find me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary interrupted, &ldquo;Oh, Sister Theresa, your
brother never stopped trying to find you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry said, &ldquo;He advertised in newspapers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nun shook her head. &ldquo;We do not take
newspapers here and Mr. Weston, who had a
nervous collapse for a long time, was not permitted
to read. Yes, that accounts for it. My
poor brother! How needlessly he grieved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry and Dick exchanged glances and Dick&rsquo;s
lips formed the word &ldquo;money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cowboy said, &ldquo;Sister Theresa, from the
tale of an old storekeeper in Gleeson, who knew
your brother well, we have learned that he has
a letter for you written in Danish which tells
where he left some money for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be glad to have the letter,&rdquo; the
woman said, her face lightening, &ldquo;not because
of the money which I will use for others, as we
here take the vow of poverty, but because of
some message I am sure the letter will contain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary, thinking of the Dooleys, wanted to ask
if the money might, part of it at least, be used
for <i>them</i> but she thought better of it.</p>
<p>The nun, looking tenderly down at the boy
who still nestled close to her, said lovingly,
&ldquo;Poor Little Jackie, how I wish I <i>could</i> keep
him here with me, but that would not be permitted
since he is a boy.&rdquo; As though inspired,
she told them, &ldquo;If that money is found, I will
give a good part of it to someone who will make
a happy home for this little fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary also was inspired. &ldquo;Oh, Sister Theresa,&rdquo;
how eagerly she spoke. &ldquo;I know the very
nicest family and they&rsquo;re in great need. Caring
for Jackie would be a godsend to them and
bring great happiness into <i>his</i> life, I&rsquo;m sure of
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she told&mdash;with Jerry&rsquo;s help&mdash;all that
she knew of Etta Dooley and her family.</p>
<p>The nun turned to the cowboy. &ldquo;I like what
you tell me about that little family. If there is
money to pay her, I would like to see your
friend Etta.&rdquo; She was rising as she spoke. A
muffled gong was ringing in the inner corridor.
The young people also rose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure Etta will come, Sister Theresa,&rdquo;
Mary said.</p>
<p>Jerry promised to try to bring the letter on
the morrow. The nun, smiling graciously at
them all, held out her hand to first one and
then another, saying, &ldquo;Thank you and goodbye.&rdquo;
The little boy echoed, &ldquo;Goodbye.&rdquo; He
was to remain with Sister Theresa until she
had met and approved of Etta Dooley.</p>
<p>As the young people were about to leave the
convent, the young nun who had admitted them
appeared and said, &ldquo;Sister Theresa invites you
to lunch. It is long after the noon hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned, not waiting for a possible refusal
and so they followed her through a side
door, along a narrow corridor which ended in
descending steps. They found themselves in
a bare basement room. There were plain
wooden tables, clean and white, with benches
on both sides. No one was in evidence as the
noon meal had been cleared away. The young
nun motioned them to a table, then glided away
to the kitchen. She soon returned with four
bowls of simple vegetable soup, glasses of milk
and a plain coarse brown bread without butter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t realized how starved I am!&rdquo; Dora
said when they were alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it too story-bookish for anything, our
finding Little Bodil at last?&rdquo; Mary exclaimed
as she ate with a relish the appetizing soup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto. It sure is,&rdquo; Jerry agreed.</p>
<p>Dick asked, &ldquo;Do you think Etta Dooley will
be too proud to take the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mary said with conviction. &ldquo;She
won&rsquo;t suspect that we had <i>wanted</i> to find some
way of giving her the money. She&rsquo;ll think that
our first thought had been to recommend a good
home for Jackie. That will make it all right
with her, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora glanced at Jerry somewhat anxiously.
&ldquo;They can stay where they are, can&rsquo;t they?
Etta said that if it weren&rsquo;t for her feeling of
being dependent on charity, she would simply
love being there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry nodded thoughtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Dad
will be glad to have them. I reckon he hasn&rsquo;t
any other plans for that cabin. We could lease
them, say three acres, and if they paid a little
rent that would make Etta feel independent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora added her thought, &ldquo;If Etta passes
those examinations she&rsquo;s going to take in Douglas,
maybe she could be teacher in that little
school near your ranch, Jerry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cowboy&rsquo;s face brightened. &ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s
a bingo-fine idea! That school had to close because
we hadn&rsquo;t any children. All we need are
eight youngsters to reopen it. Let&rsquo;s see, there
are the twins, Jackie will make three.&rdquo; Then,
anxiously he glanced at Mary. &ldquo;How soon can
Baby Bess go to school?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d <i>have</i> to go if Etta did,&rdquo; was the
laughing reply.</p>
<p>Dora suggested, &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t there be a kindergarten
department?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon so.&rdquo; The cowboy&rsquo;s face was
troubled. &ldquo;Four kids aren&rsquo;t eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick, remembering something Mr. Newcomb
told his wife, inquired, &ldquo;Jerry, your dad asked
your mother if she minded having a cowboy
next winter who had a wife and six children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jolly-O!&rdquo; Dora cried. &ldquo;What did Mrs.
Newcomb say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Mary who replied, &ldquo;You know what
dear, big-hearted Aunt Mollie would say. I can
almost hear her tell Uncle Henry that &lsquo;the
more the merrier.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Jerry told them, &ldquo;even if we
can work the school plan, the salary is mighty
small. It wouldn&rsquo;t more than pay their grocery
bill but it&rsquo;ll help all right, along with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary caught the cowboy&rsquo;s arm, her expression
alarmed. &ldquo;Jerry, <i>what</i> if there <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> any
money in that rock house after our planning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow we will know,&rdquo; Dick said. Then,
as the young nun reappeared, they arose and
thanked her for the good meal. Dora noticed
that as Dick passed out he dropped a coin in
a little box labeled, FOR THE POOR.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<h2 id="c28"><br />CHAPTER XXVIII
<br />A NEW COMPLICATION</h2>
<p>In the lumbering old police ambulance, the
four young people returned to Tombstone and
found Harry Hulbert sitting in a rocker on the
hotel porch waiting for them. He ran toward
them waving his cap boyishly. The &ldquo;Seagull&rdquo;
reposed in the middle of the square surrounded
by interested and curious cowboys who had
ridden in from the range for the mail. Many
of them had come from far and had heard nothing
of the &ldquo;Seagull&rsquo;s&rdquo; part in the recent raid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do we go from here?&rdquo; Harry asked
when he had learned of the morning adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can take Mr. Goode&rsquo;s small car,&rdquo;
Mary began, but Harry interrupted with,
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be done! They&rsquo;re both out, one gone to
Bisbee and the other to Nogales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Big Brother,&rdquo; Mary exclaimed,
&ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t Harry sit in the front side door of
your car? We girls used to ride that way at
school sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo; the cowboy agreed. &ldquo;All
aboard, let&rsquo;s get going.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>Mary smiled up at him happily. &ldquo;If the calf
has been milking the cow all this time, it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry shook his head. &ldquo;No such luck&mdash;for
the calf. Mother can milk in an emergency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ride to Gleeson was a merry one. Harry
sat, literally, at Mary&rsquo;s feet, looking up at her
admiringly and directing his conversation to
her almost entirely. Jerry was very silent. No
one but Dora noticed that. When Gleeson was
reached, the small car stopped in front of the
store and they all rushed in and astounded the
old storekeeper with their exultant shout,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found Little Bodil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t so!&rdquo; He stared at them unbelievingly.
&ldquo;Arter all these years! Wall, wall! I&rsquo;ll
be dum-blasted! So Little Bodil is one o&rsquo; them
nun-women.&rdquo; While he talked, he went behind
his counter, took an old cigar box from a high
shelf, opened it and held out an envelope, yellowed
with age. He handed it to Jerry. &ldquo;Take
it to Little Bodil. I&rsquo;ll be cu&rsquo;ros to hear what
all&rsquo;s in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are we, Mr. Harvey,&rdquo; Mary began, then
exclaimed contritely, &ldquo;Oh, how terrible of us.
We haven&rsquo;t introduced the hero of the hour.
Mr. Silas Harvey, this is the air scout who located
the train robbers, Harry Hulbert. He
seems like an old friend to us, doesn&rsquo;t he,
Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo; the cowboy replied, then
glancing at the old dust-covered clock, he
quickly added, &ldquo;Dick, I reckon I must be getting
along over to <i>Bar N</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye, Mr. Harvey. Glad to have met
you.&rdquo; Harry shook hands with the old man.</p>
<p>When they were outside the post office, the
air scout turned to the cowboy. &ldquo;Jerry, can&rsquo;t I
be your letter carrier?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;While I
was waiting for you in Tombstone I enquired
about the stage. I can get back there in about
an hour. Then I must fly to Tucson for a meeting
at headquarters tonight. I can motor out
to the convent and be back here tomorrow
morning with the letter translated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds all right to me,&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And during the hour that you have to wait
for the stage,&rdquo; Mary turned brightly toward
Harry, &ldquo;you may become acquainted with the
nicest dad in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forgetting the presence of the others, Harry
replied, &ldquo;Is <i>that</i> why his daughter is the nicest
girl in the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary flushed bewitchingly, but it was evident
that she was embarrassed.</p>
<p>Jerry drove them up to the Moore house,
waited while Dick bounded indoors to speak
to his mother, then they two rode away, promising
to return as soon as they could the next
day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>Dora, who had been watching Jerry&rsquo;s face,
knew that he had been deeply hurt, but she was
sure he would not say anything to influence
Mary. Dora thought, &ldquo;He wants her to choose
the one of them who would make her happier,
I suppose. Believe me, it wouldn&rsquo;t take <i>me</i> long
to decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Moore had heard nothing of the robbery
or the raid. Mrs. Farley had not wished to
cause him a moment&rsquo;s anxiety about the safety
of his idolized daughter. She had told him that
the girls were spending the night with Mrs.
Goode in Tombstone, and, since the wife of the
Deputy Sheriff had been a close friend of
Mary&rsquo;s mother, he had thought little of it. Even
now that it was all over, they decided to merely
introduce Harry as a friend of Patsy and Polly,
who had come West to be attached to the border
patrol.</p>
<p>Mr. Moore welcomed the boy gladly, and, for
half an hour, they talked together of the East
and the West. Mary and Dora slipped away and
returned with lemonade and a plate of Carmelita&rsquo;s
cookie-snaps.</p>
<p>Then the two girls walked down to the cross
road with Harry and waited until he climbed
aboard the funny old &rsquo;bus and rode away.</p>
<p>He bent low over Mary at the last moment.
Dora had not heard his whispered words, but
she knew by the sudden flush that they had been
complimentary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>Arm in arm they turned and walked back up
the gently ascending hill-road toward their
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like the newcomer?&rdquo; Dora
tried to make her voice sound indifferent.</p>
<p>Mary laughingly confessed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d really like
him lots better if he didn&rsquo;t flatter me so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora replied, &ldquo;I know how you feel. I&rsquo;d
heaps rather have a boy be just a good pal.
It makes a person feel, oh, as if she were the
sort of a girl a boy thought he had to make love
to, or she wouldn&rsquo;t be having a good time. I&rsquo;ve
known steens of them, fine fellows really, who
came over from Wales Military to our dances.
They thought the only way they could put it
over big was to flatter their partners. You know
<i>that</i> as well as I do. Why, we Quadralettes have
compared notes time and again and found the
same boy had said the same complimentary
thing to all four of us.&rdquo; Mary made no reply,
so Dora continued, &ldquo;Dick and Jerry are the
sort of boy friends I like. They treat us as if
we could be talked to about something besides
ourselves. I tell you, the girl who can win the
love of Jerry Newcomb is going to win one of
the finest men who walks on this green earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora&rsquo;s tone was so earnest that Mary
laughed. &ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; she teased. &ldquo;Why all
this eloquence? There isn&rsquo;t any green earth
around here for Jerry to walk on. It&rsquo;s all
sand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>Suddenly Dora changed the subject. &ldquo;Why
do you suppose Little Bodil is called Sister
Theresa?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Mary replied rather absently, &ldquo;Oh, I think
they give up their own and choose a saint&rsquo;s
name. Anyhow, I&rsquo;ve heard they do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evident she was thinking deeply of
something else.</p>
<p>Her thoughtfulness continued until after
supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a wonderful moonlight night!&rdquo; Dora
said as the two girls seated themselves on the
top step of the front porch to gaze out across
the shimmering desert valley, below the tableland
on which they lived. &ldquo;I wish Jerry and
Dick would come and take us for a ride.&rdquo;
Hardly had she said the words when they saw
a dark object scudding along on the valley
road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody <i>is</i> coming toward Gleeson from
the <i>Bar N</i> ranch way,&rdquo; Mary said, and Dora
noted that her voice was eager, as though she
wanted, <i>very much wanted</i>, to see her silent
cowboy lover.</p>
<p>For a long time they sat watching the narrow
strip of cross road beyond the post office. If
the car turned, it would surely be coming to
the Moore place. If it passed, it would be going
on to Tombstone probably. It turned. More
slowly it climbed the grade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the little &lsquo;tin Cayuse,&rsquo; all right,&rdquo; Dora
said. She was watching the eager light in
Mary&rsquo;s face, lovely in the moonlight. Then,
suddenly its brightness was shadowed, went
out. Dora saw the reason. On the front seat
with Jerry was another girl, a glowing-eyed,
truly beautiful girl, Etta Dooley. In the rumble
with Dick were two freckle-faced boys, the
twins. Their ruddy faces were glowing with
grins of delight. &ldquo;Hurray!&rdquo; they shouted as
the small car stopped near the front porch.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re out moonlight riding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick quieted them, remembering that Mr.
Moore might be asleep. Mary, looking pale in
the silver light, went down to the car and asked
Etta if she wouldn&rsquo;t get out. &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo;
that maiden replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve left Baby Bess with
Aunt Mollie and we&rsquo;ve been gone more than
an hour now, I do believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t seemed that long, has it?&rdquo; Jerry
was actually looking at Etta and not at Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed not!&rdquo; was the happily given
reply. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a treat for the twins and me to
fly through space. Once upon a time I had a
little car of my own, but that seems <i>ages</i> ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This did not seem like the same Etta Dooley
who had been so reserved when the girls had
called at her cabin home. <i>What</i> had happened
to change her, Dora wondered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>When the car turned and the small boys, remembering
to be quiet, had nevertheless performed
gleeful antics, Mary went up the steps
and into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to bed,&rdquo; she said and her voice
sounded tired.</p>
<p>Dora, wickedly pleased, could not let well
enough alone. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that Etta was
so well acquainted as to call Jerry&rsquo;s mother
Aunt Mollie.&rdquo; She wisely did not add her next
thought, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to look to your laurels,
Mary-mine. Etta&rsquo;s a mighty attractive girl and
she simply loves the <i>Bar N</i> ranch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Dora spoke again, it was on an entirely
different subject. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful,
Mary, to think that we&rsquo;ve solved the mystery
of Little Bodil and that tomorrow, perhaps,
the boys are going to defy that Evil Eye Turquoise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Mary replied indifferently.
Dora turned out the light and with a shrug got
into bed with her friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<h2 id="c29"><br />CHAPTER XXIX
<br />AN OLD LETTER</h2>
<p>The next day, directly after breakfast,
Mary and Dora began to expect someone to
arrive. The roof of the front porch was railed
around and when they had made their bed and
tidied their room they stepped out of the door-like
window and stood there gazing about them.
From that high elevation they had a view of
the road coming from Tombstone as it climbed
to the tableland and also they could see for
miles across the desert valley toward the
<i>Bar N</i> ranch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you think will be the first to
arrive?&rdquo; Dora asked as she slipped an arm
about her friend&rsquo;s waist.</p>
<p>Mary shook her head without replying. Then,
because her conscience had been troubling her,
Dora said impulsively, &ldquo;Mary, dear, I didn&rsquo;t
mean, last night, that Harry Hulbert says nice
things to you without meaning them. No one
could help thinking you&rsquo;re&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary laughed and put a finger on her
friend&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;Now, who&rsquo;s flattering?&rdquo; Then,
excitedly, &ldquo;I hear a car, but I don&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There it is, by the post office,&rdquo; Dora
pointed, then, in a tone of disappointment, &ldquo;Oh,
it&rsquo;s only that funny little Jap vegetable man
from Fairbanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later, when they were looking in
different directions, they both exclaimed in
chorus, &ldquo;Here come Jerry and Dick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Deputy Sheriff&rsquo;s little car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In through the window they leaped, down
the front stairway they tripped and were standing
in the graveled walk between the red and
gold border-beds when the two cars arrived,
Jerry&rsquo;s in the lead.</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s heart was heavy, though she tried
to smile brightly, when she saw that Etta
Dooley was again on the front seat with Jerry.
Dick, this time, was quite alone. Harry Hulbert,
although in the rear, leaped out and
bounded to Mary so quickly that he reached
her first.</p>
<p>Her welcome, though friendly, lacked the
eager graciousness of the day before. Harry,
however, did not seem to notice it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
the translation here,&rdquo; he said, waving the old
yellow envelope.</p>
<p>Jerry got out of his car, turned to speak to
Etta and then walked toward the waiting group.
Dick had already disappeared into the house
in search of his mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>Etta, remaining in the car, called, &ldquo;Good
morning&rdquo; to the girls. Jerry explained, &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t told Etta the whole story, just the part
about Little Bodil and the rock house. She
was so interested, I told her we&rsquo;d be glad to
have her go with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary smiled at him rather wistfully, Dora
thought. Then she walked to the side of the
car and said, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you get out, Etta, while
we read the letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry, who had followed her, said, &ldquo;Dick
wanted us to wait till we got to the rock house
before we read the letter. Can you girls go
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll get my hat.&rdquo; Mary turned to go
indoors. Dora went with her and they were
back almost at once to find Jerry beside Etta,
with Dick waiting to help Dora to her usual
place in the rumble.</p>
<p>Harry, his rather thin face alight with pleasure,
took Mary&rsquo;s arm and, giving it a slight
pressure, exclaimed in a low voice, &ldquo;The gods
are kind! I hardly dared hope that your old
friends would let me have you today. I&rsquo;ve
thought of you every minute since I left you
last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary, seated at his side in the small car,
turned serious eyes toward him. &ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; she
said almost pleadingly, &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t talk to
me that way. I&mdash;I&rsquo;d rather you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>An expression of sadness for a moment put
out the eager light in his eyes, then, good
sportsman that he was, he said, &ldquo;Very well,
Mary. I think I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that his conversation was interesting,
but general, until they reached the towering
rock gate where Jerry&rsquo;s car was standing, waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a lonely, awesome spot this is!&rdquo;
Harry exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think <i>this</i> is awesome,&rdquo; Mary
laughed, &ldquo;wait until we pass through those
gates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry climbed out, helped Etta, then turned
to call, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get off the road, Harry. The
sand&rsquo;s so soft we&rsquo;d have a time pulling you
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora and Dick leaped from the rumble and
were joined by Mary and Harry. &ldquo;We walk
the rest of the way,&rdquo; Dick told the air scout,
&ldquo;and believe me it&rsquo;s hard going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary glanced ahead, saw Jerry assisting
Etta as in former times he had assisted her
when her feet sank ankle deep in the soft, white
sand. Harry gallantly took her arm to aid her.
Mary smiled at him wanly. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I wish I were the self-reliant athletic
type like Dora. She never needs help.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>Harry bit his lip to keep from saying aloud
what he thought. Before he could think of
something else to say, Dick looked back and
called to him, &ldquo;Were you ever any place where
there was such a deathlike stillness as there is
in this small walled-in spot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry shook his head. &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; he replied.
Then, glad of the interruption, he asked,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the rock house, up there, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the poor old
fellow they called &lsquo;Lucky Loon&rsquo; buried himself
alive, if there&rsquo;s any truth in the yarn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, that would take more courage
than I&rsquo;ve got,&rdquo; Harry declared with a shudder.</p>
<p>Jerry, glancing back, and finding that he and
Etta were quite far ahead, turned and waited,
still holding his companion&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>Etta&rsquo;s intelligent face <i>never</i> had seemed
more attractive to Mary. The melancholy expression,
which the girls had noticed, especially,
the day they had called upon her, had
vanished. Her eyes were bright with interest.</p>
<p>They walked on in a close group. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m simply
wild to know what&rsquo;s in the letter Little Bodil
translated,&rdquo; Dora exclaimed.</p>
<p>Dick laughed. &ldquo;I suppose we will call that
dignified Sister Theresa &lsquo;Little Bodil&rsquo; till the
end of time,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>When they reached the foot of the leaning
rock, which had one time been the stairway to
the rock house, they gathered about Jerry who
was opening the yellowed envelope. Intense
interest and excitement was expressed in each
face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>Sister Theresa had written a liberal translation
between the almost faded lines of her
dead brother&rsquo;s letter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Little Bodil&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my heart I feel you are alive. I have
hunted all over Arizona, New Mexico and
across the border. No one has heard of you.
I can&rsquo;t search any longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I die I want to tell you where my
gold is. Silas Harvey will tell you where my
rock house is. Secret entrance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jerry paused and looked in dismay at the
interested listeners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Dick asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old writing was so faded Sister Theresa
couldn&rsquo;t make it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How terrible!&rdquo; Dora cried. &ldquo;How to get
<i>into</i> the rock house is the <i>very thing</i> we need
to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at least we know there <i>is</i> a secret
entrance,&rdquo; Mary told them. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there any
more of the translation, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>The cowboy had turned a page. He nodded.
&ldquo;Yes, here&rsquo;s something but I reckon it won&rsquo;t
help much. There are only a few words.&rdquo; He
read, &ldquo;Find money&mdash;walled in&mdash;turquoise eye.&rdquo;
Jerry looked from one to the other and said,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all. Doesn&rsquo;t help out much, does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary took the letter. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a note at the
bottom. Sister Theresa wrote, &lsquo;I am sorry I
could not make out the entire message. I do
hope this much will aid you in finding the
money if it has not been stolen.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dick was looking along the base of
the almost perpendicular cliff on which the rock
house stood, &ldquo;I vote we start in hunting for a
secret entrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O. K.,&rdquo; Harry said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s divide our
forces, one going to the right and the other to
the left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry, as though it were the natural thing
to do, said to Etta, &ldquo;Shall <i>we</i> go this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary turned and started in the opposite direction.
Harry was quick to follow her. Dora
and Dick remained standing directly under the
rock house. Dora said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m puzzled! <i>Not</i>
about the secret entrance but about Mary and
Jerry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;ll come out all right.&rdquo; It was plain
that Dick wasn&rsquo;t giving romance much thought,
for he added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going in between the main
cliff and this broken off piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora, going to his side, peered into the crack.
The winds of many years had blown sand into
it. She was surprised to see Dick start pulling
the sand away from the wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a hunch?&rdquo; she asked with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not really,&rdquo; he told her. Then remarked,
&ldquo;Wish I had a shovel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have one,&rdquo; Dora said, &ldquo;if you
want to go back to the road. I saw a shovel and
an axe fastened under the Deputy Sheriff&rsquo;s
car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry and Etta, having found nothing, were
returning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you uncovering, Dick?&rdquo; the cowboy
called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, fetch a shovel, will you?&rdquo; was the
answer he received. &ldquo;Dora says there&rsquo;s one
under the &lsquo;Dep&rsquo;s&rsquo; car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto.&rdquo; The cowboy&rsquo;s long legs carried him
rapidly toward the rock gate. He had returned
with the shovel just as Mary and Harry came
up. They had found nothing that could possibly
be a secret entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your reasoning, Dick, old man?&rdquo;
Jerry asked as he handed him the shovel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s <i>something</i> here that caught
and held the sand,&rdquo; Dick replied. &ldquo;It may not
be what we&rsquo;re looking for but I&rsquo;m curious to
know what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<h2 id="c30"><br />CHAPTER XXX
<br />SECRET ENTRANCE TO THE ROCK HOUSE</h2>
<p>The boys took turns in throwing the sand
out of the crack. The faces of the three girls,
standing idly near, expressed different emotions.
Mary&rsquo;s sweet sensitive mouth and tender
eyes were wistful, almost sad. She was not
thinking of the secret entrance. Dora, watching
her, was troubled and wished she knew just
what Mary was thinking. Etta, alone, watched
the boys as they threw shovelsful of sand out
of the crack. Her eyes shone with a new light.
Dora, glancing at her, wondered if she were
watching Jerry&rsquo;s splendid strength as he hurled
the sand. Once he caught her encouraging
glance and smiled at her.</p>
<p>Etta turned and, seeing Mary beside her, she
slipped an arm about her. With a fleeting return
of her old seriousness, she said, &ldquo;You
girls can&rsquo;t know what it means to me to be included
in all this. I&rsquo;ve been so lonely for companions
of my own age.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>Mary was about to say that she was glad,
also, when a shout from the boys attracted
their attention. They hurried toward the crack
where the three diggers stood intently examining
something they had uncovered.</p>
<p>It was a huge stone about three feet round
which leaned against a hole in the base of the
cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That hole <i>must</i> be the secret entrance.&rdquo;
Dick glowed around with the pride of discovery.
&ldquo;The rock caught and held the sand, you
see,&rdquo; he explained to the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast, old man.&rdquo; Harry Hulbert was
measuring the space between the rock and the
hole. &ldquo;If Mr. Pedersen buried himself alive
up there in his rock house, he <i>had</i> to have room
to crawl <i>into</i> his entrance. You&rsquo;ll all agree to
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They silently nodded, then Jerry said, &ldquo;I
reckon Sven Pedersen was very thin, sick as
he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Etta alertly suggested, &ldquo;I think the hole
might have been uncovered then, but that the
weight of the sand has gradually pushed the
rock down against the opening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto!&rdquo; Jerry&rsquo;s smile was approving.</p>
<p>Dora remarked, &ldquo;Since we are not hunting
for the old man&rsquo;s bones, isn&rsquo;t the important
question whether or not this hole leads up into
the rock house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the only way to find out is to get this
stone out of the way,&rdquo; Dick told them. &ldquo;Now
everybody push.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>It was a difficult task and after what seemed
a long hard effort, there was barely room for
one of the boys to get in.</p>
<p>Jerry crawled into the hole but backed out
almost at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s black as a pocket,&rdquo; he reported. &ldquo;It
would be foolhardy to go in until we have a
light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get one,&rdquo; Dick volunteered. &ldquo;The Deputy
Sheriff has a powerful flash in his car.
Back in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was gone, Jerry told his impressions
of the hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to be a slanting tunnel, not high
enough to stand in. I reckon that at some past
time it was made by rushing water, it&rsquo;s worn
so smooth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jerry, please don&rsquo;t go in there all
alone.&rdquo; It was Mary imploring. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m smaller
than you are. Let me go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s grateful glance was infinitely tender
and so was his voice as he replied, &ldquo;Little
Sister, I&rsquo;ll be careful not to run into danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he crawled into the hole. The watching
young people saw the flash of the light, then
they heard his voice sounding uncanny and far
off. &ldquo;The tunnel goes up, sort of like a waterfall.
I reckon I can climb it all right, but don&rsquo;t
anybody try to follow me, lest-be I&rsquo;m gone too
long; more than fifteen minutes, say.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>The color left Mary&rsquo;s face and she clung to
Dora, but she tried not to let the others see how
truly anxious she was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One minute.&rdquo; Dick was looking at his
watch.</p>
<p>Harry on his knees peered up into the darkness,
but could not even see Jerry&rsquo;s light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five minutes,&rdquo; Dick reported.</p>
<p>Mary asked tremulously, &ldquo;That couldn&rsquo;t be
the cave of a mountain lion or a puma or a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nixy on that!&rdquo; Dick replied emphatically.
&ldquo;No wild animal, not even my friend, a Gila
Monster, would care to try to climb <i>that</i> smooth
toboggan slide. Puzzle to me is how Jerry is
doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; Mary whispered, holding up one
finger. &ldquo;Did you hear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick plunged in with &ldquo;a gun shot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; Mary flared at him. She ran
to the hole and knelt by it and listened. &ldquo;I
thought I heard Jerry call far, <i>far</i> away,&rdquo; she
said as she stood up and went back to stand by
Dora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten minutes.&rdquo; Dick glanced from his watch
to Harry. &ldquo;Go back a way, will you, and look
up at the rock house. If Jerry called, maybe it
was from up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary, no longer trying to hide her anxiety,
ran beyond the leaning ledge and looked up.
How her face shone with joy and relief!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jerry!&rdquo; she cried, beckoning the others.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s up there standing in the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry cupped one hand about his ear. &ldquo;What
say, Jerry? All right. Sure thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; Jerry had disappeared
in the house when the others joined Mary and
Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said there&rsquo;s an old wire ladder contraption
that he&rsquo;s going to drop down to us,&rdquo; Harry
explained as Jerry reappeared on the ledge.
Gradually a wire-rope ladder slid down the
steep cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, you and Harry come on up,&rdquo; Jerry
called. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s safe all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You girls won&rsquo;t mind being left alone, will
you?&rdquo; Harry asked in his chivalrous way, of
all of them, although he looked at Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Go along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys went up the swaying ladder so
easily that Mary, usually the less courageous
one of the two, said to Dora, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up.
Catch me if I fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three boys were in the rock house and
did not know that the girls had climbed the
ladder until they saw them standing near the
open door.</p>
<p>Jerry leaped toward them. &ldquo;Little Sister,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;<i>what</i> if you had fallen?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>Dora thought complacently, &ldquo;Well, I guess
<i>that</i> lover&rsquo;s misunderstanding is patched up all
right. It didn&rsquo;t matter, evidently, whether or
not Etta fell, and as for Dora Bellman&mdash;&rdquo; she
laughed and shrugged her broad, capable
shoulders.</p>
<p>Mary was asking, &ldquo;Has anyone seen the
Evil Eye Turquoise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet. Come, let&rsquo;s look for it,&rdquo; the cowboy
called, adding, as he turned to his neighbor,
&ldquo;Etta, I didn&rsquo;t tell you that part of the
story, did I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smilingly, and evidently untroubled by the
recent by-play between the cowboy and Mary,
she replied in the negative. So, standing near
the open door, they all told parts of the tale to
the interested listener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if something terrible <i>always</i> happens
when that turquoise eye looks at an intruder,&rdquo;
Etta said, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you afraid something terrible
will happen now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I <i>would</i>, if I believed the yarn,&rdquo;
Jerry replied. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see! Where was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the back wall, gazing <i>straight out</i> of the
front door,&rdquo; Mary reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t there <i>now</i> anyway.&rdquo; Harry
fearlessly had crossed the small bare room to
investigate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it must have been there,&rdquo; Dick insisted.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember that Smart Aleky fellow
who <i>did</i> climb up and who really <i>did</i> fall over
the cliff, paralyzed, when he saw the Evil
Eye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we do,&rdquo; Jerry agreed. Having
found a stout stick cane in one corner, he poked
it into the sand that covered the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi-ho!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I see what&rsquo;s happened.
The Eye fell off of the wall and is buried here
in the sand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for you!&rdquo; Dick shouted, and before
any of them could stop him, he had seized the
fateful stone and had turned the flashlight full
upon it. Mary screamed and clutched Dora, but
they had all looked at the Eye and <i>it</i> had looked
at them, yet nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Dora, secretly proud of Dick&rsquo;s courage,
asked, &ldquo;What is it made of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You impostor!&rdquo; Dick hissed at the Eye.
&ldquo;You are only adobe with a blue stone in your
middle.&rdquo; Then calmly he pocketed it as he
grinningly announced, &ldquo;Nobody objecting, I&rsquo;m
going to keep it for Lucky Stone and a paper
weight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; Mary shuddered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome
to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora was asking, &ldquo;Where do you think we&rsquo;d
better look for the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the old codger&rsquo;s tomb, I should say.&rdquo;
Harry was greatly enjoying his share in this
rather uncanny adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>They all agreed that the walled-in tomb
would be the most likely place to find the treasure.</p>
<p>Jerry looked anxiously at the three girls who
stood close together watching, wide-eyed. &ldquo;I
reckon you all ought to have stayed down below,&rdquo;
he told them.</p>
<p>Dora replied courageously, &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t mind
us. Open up the tomb if you want. There won&rsquo;t
be anything but a skeleton, and we see those
every day on the desert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry and Dick, prying around, discovered a
large stone that was loose, but when it was
lifted out, they found only a small niche. <i>In it
was an iron box which the boys removed. Then
they replaced the stone.</i> After all they had not
needed to open up the tomb.</p>
<p>When they all had descended the wire-rope
ladder, they left it hanging, believing that some
day they might want to revisit the rock house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Jerry said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s take the box to
Sister Theresa.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<h2 id="c31"><br />CHAPTER XXXI
<br />A WONDERFUL SECRET TOLD</h2>
<p>The boys took turns carrying the heavy box
back to the cars and the girls walked three
abreast, laughing joyfully in their efforts to
keep each other from stumbling in the sand.
They whispered together just before they
passed through the rock gate and when the boys
turned toward them, after having stored the
box safely under the seat of the Deputy
Sheriff&rsquo;s car, Mary made a bow and said,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve forgotten what verse it is, but we&rsquo;ll
sing for you anyway.&rdquo; Then merrily Dora and
Etta joined her:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Three girl sleuths you now behold</p>
<p class="t0">Who have helped you find the gems and gold.</p>
<p class="t4">Come, come, coma,</p>
<p class="t4">Coma, coma, kee.</p>
<p class="t4">To Phantom Town</p>
<p class="t5">For a cup of tea.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Which means,&rdquo; Mary interpreted, &ldquo;that
it&rsquo;s noon by the sun and I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re all
hungry. I told Carmelita to make an extra large
tamale pie.&rdquo; Then, before anyone could reply,
Mary added mischievously: &ldquo;Dick, I&rsquo;m going
to ride in the rumble with you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>Harry chivalrously bowed to the girl nearest
him, saying, &ldquo;May I have the pleasure?&rdquo; It
was Etta and she flashed him a bright smile of
acceptance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Jerry!&rdquo; Dora condoned as she took
the seat beside the cowboy. &ldquo;Some imp has got
into Mary.&rdquo; But the glance that he gave her
was far more pleased than disturbed.</p>
<p>Carmelita welcomed them at the kitchen door
with a beaming smile that revealed her gleaming
white teeth. Jerry introduced the air scout
who surprised the girls by replying in perfect
Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m green with envy!&rdquo; Dora told him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to study Spanish next fall if it&rsquo;s taught
at our Sunnybank Seminary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you two are going back East to school
this fall,&rdquo; Harry said as they seated themselves
around the kitchen table, cheerful with its red
cloth and steaming tamale pie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mary nodded brightly. &ldquo;Dad is well
enough to go with me, Mrs. Farley says. Jerry
has one more year over at the State University
and Dick is going back East to study medicine.
Oh, I forgot to say that Mrs. Farley is going to
stay with us and help me take care of Dad. We
three are going to rent a little house near
Dora&rsquo;s home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>The conversation changed to the box. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
eager to know what is in it,&rdquo; Mary said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted Little Bodil to be the one to open
it,&rdquo; Jerry explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How shall we get it to her?&rdquo; Etta asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a suggestion,&rdquo; Harry said. &ldquo;It will
end the suspense sooner than any other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Do tell us!&rdquo; came in eager chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess,&rdquo; Harry turned to Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> will take the box in your Seagull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; Harry told her. Then to
Jerry, &ldquo;If Etta would like to fly over with me,
I&rsquo;d be glad to have company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d love to fly,&rdquo; Etta said, &ldquo;but I ought
not to be the one; surely you, Mary, or Dora&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can all go up later,&rdquo; said Jerry.</p>
<p>As they were about to start, Jerry drew
Harry aside and said: &ldquo;You understand we
want Etta to believe the plan comes from Sister
Theresa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry nodded. When he was in the car, Jerry
called: &ldquo;When you come back, you can land in
the barnyard at <i>Bar N</i>. We&rsquo;ll all be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what <i>fun</i> that will be!&rdquo; Mary flashed a
bright smile at Jerry; then taking Dora by the
hand, she skipped indoors.</p>
<p>When they rejoined Jerry and Dick, after
telling Mrs. Farley where they were going, the
cowboy assisted the fair shining-eyed girl up on
the front seat and sat beside her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>There was wistfulness in Jerry&rsquo;s tones when
he spoke. &ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;re mighty pleased that
your dad&rsquo;s well enough to go back East.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s eyes were glad bits of June blue skies.
&ldquo;Pleased isn&rsquo;t a joyful enough word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they came to the long road that crossed
over the desert for many miles without a curve,
she whispered, &ldquo;Jerry, let&rsquo;s fly across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cowboy shook his head. &ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;ve
forgotten what happened once before&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Then suddenly changing
the subject, she asked, &ldquo;How long before the
Seagull will get to <i>Bar N</i>, do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon soon after we do,&rdquo; Jerry said. Dick
scanned the sky. Far away there was a speck
growing larger. Lower and lower the circling
Seagull dropped, then landed gracefully and
easily. Before the others could reach them,
Harry had helped Etta out of the pit. A small
boy clambered out without help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All is well!&rdquo; Dora said to Dick. &ldquo;Sister
Theresa has given little Jack to Etta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was simply too wonderful for words,&rdquo;
Etta told the girls. &ldquo;We went so high that the
mountain ranges looked like, well, a row of
tents, maybe.&rdquo; Then, as Jackie nestled close to
her, she told what had happened. &ldquo;There was
real gold money in that box and Government
bonds and beautiful blue gems. Harry took it
all to the bank that looks after the convent&rsquo;s
finances, and, oh, I guess you&rsquo;re wondering why
little Jack is here. Sister Theresa asked me if
I&rsquo;d be willing to let him live with us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ever so glad for the little fellow,&rdquo; Mary
hurried to say. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she added, whirling
to look from one to another, &ldquo;if no one is
too tired, I want to ride up to Jerry&rsquo;s own
ranch. I want to look at the view from there
before I go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora and Dick exchanged puzzled glances.
They were sure that Mary&rsquo;s flushed excitement
had something to do with her plan, but <i>what</i>?
Harry was enthusiastic as they rode in the
shade of the trees. &ldquo;<i>What</i> a place for a summer
home,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;so cool and restful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary and Jerry were some distance ahead.
They reached the far-flung ledge where the cowboy
had said he someday planned to build a
house. Riding close to him, the fair girl asked,
&ldquo;Big Brother, <i>when</i> are you going to build a
house here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; the cowboy said, &ldquo;unless someday
<i>you&rsquo;ll</i> be willing to make a real home of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary put a frail hand on the brown one that
held the reins. &ldquo;Please start the house,&rdquo; she
said in a low happy voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be ready as
soon as I graduate next June.&rdquo;</p>
